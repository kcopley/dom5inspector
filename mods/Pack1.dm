The frightening speed of their attacks allows these spiders to kill unprepared and poorly armored troops within seconds, and chase down fleeing soldiers. Unfortunately, the incredible speed and frantic bursts of action of these automatons also deplete their cores much faster than other types of spiderlings, making them fall silent on the battlefield all the quicker.

The Senate turns a blind eye and allows the women of the Republic the occasional whim as long as it keeps them from engaging in politics. As such, the women of the Republic are free to practice warfare in the temples of Aurum until marriage. The Aurumian war maidens are nicknamed harpies on account of the battle shrieks and ferocity with which they enter battle. Since they are not as strong as men or as well equipped on account of not being part of the army, they often train to fight in tight formation, using simple wooden shields and spears."

#descr "In the early days of the Republic many families rose to prominence practically overnight, fueled by the immense riches gained through conquest. Soon a trend was started among the patricians and high-born lords and ladies to display their newfound riches, which quickly turned into a competition of an outrageous display of wealth. But as the Republic continued to grow and expand, so did the competition. Palaces, temples, and entire legions were soon adorned with gold-platting, giving birth to the Republic's Golden Legions, but also its exorbitantly decadent reputation. It was not until a regiment of fierce high-born ladies in full golden battle gear appeared in front of the High Temple of Aurum in one of the numerous triumphal processions that the competition and the fad was ended, for the magical golden armor and weaponry could not be outdone and nothing could have possibly been more lavish and awe-striking than warrior maidens adorned in majestic pure golden armor and weaponry. A sacred order was formed then for the privileged high-born ladies, and the newly-named Golden Daughters of Aurum were freed of the usual social obligations to marry and bear children. Those who joined the order left behind their family names and became daughters of the Republic. Any sexual relationship with a citizen was therefor considered to be incestum and an act of treason harshly punished. Within their own order the Golden Daughters are given full autonomy and are even allowed to join the Golden Legion under special directive and command of the Consuls. Golden Daughters are sacred to the people of Aurum; doubly so by being both formidable warriors of the faith, and the daughters of the Republic and prominent patricians."

#name "Magistrate"
#descr "Magistrates are elected officials of the Republic tasked with enforcing the will of the Senate. The office of a Magistrate holds numerous, often vastly differing duties, and Magistrates frequently fill the roles of judges, lawmakers, administrators, scribes, and even generals. While anyone can become a Magistrate in the free, democratic Republic of Aurum, most, if not all Magistrates are typically elected from one of the wealthy and influential families of the patrician class. Though many Magistrates are loyal and devoted sons of the Republic, nepotism, corruption, and indolence are also wide-spread in the Republic's vast bureaucratic engine. Lofty and superfluous positions are often invented for the sons of influential and wealthy Senators, fraud and embezzlement is deep-rooted like a cancer, and scandals often shake the political scene.
In provinces where a Senate is established and maintained, Magistrates may be promoted to a higher office with more power and subsequently more responsibility. As the Republic grows so will its bureaucratic apparatus, and once a sufficient number of Magistrates are elevated to a higher rank, a Census will be held across the Republic, and a specialized office opened in the capital to keep track of the exact number of subjects in all the Republic's provinces.
Some of the loyal sons of the Republic elevated to the position of a High Magistrate even end up using their influence and family wealth to approve and fund ambitious projects across the Republic.
Unlike mages, Magistrates are completely unaffected by either Magic or Drain scales and will neither suffer a penalty, nor receive a research bonus."

#descr "During the founding days of Aurum, when the Rexaurum - the Golden Kings, still ruled, the Senate served as little more than an advisory council to the kings. The overthrow of the last Golden King by a group of ambitious senators signalized the birth of the Republic. Over the coming years the Senate continued to gain power and assert itself until all legislative and executive power lay within the Senate. Its influence has grown to such proportion as to have a city without a Senate is unthinkable and an affront to the citizens and the spirit of the Republic.To stop any single Senator from amassing too much power and a return to the olden days of dictatorship, measures were installed. Once a Senator takes the office he is no longer allowed to directly and openly exert and spread his influence like regular patricians who often curry favors with the plebeian class by providing patronage or gifts for the purpose of gaining influence. Senators typically come from the wealthy patrician class, though it is not unheard-of for a commoner to be elevated to the rank of a Senator.
A city must have at least five Senators to form a local Senate and maintain full legislative power within it. Once a year, during Spring, the capital Senate of Aurum will hold elections in order to appoint two Consuls from the ranks of the Senators, to defend the Republic and lead the Golden Legions of Aurum into war.
Having five Senators in a fortified province will establish a Senate site. Provinces under 5k population do not require a Senate, though those with larger populations will demand one. Once a year, during Spring, the Senate will levy an additional tax and use portions of it to raise an army. The amount of troops raised will depend on how densely populated a province is."

It is not uncommon for Golden Priestesses to lead legions into battle personally as they are competent commanders and skilled warriors themselves. When not involved in military campaigns the Golden Priestesses spend their time training Harpies in temples."

Though there is no law as such that forbids male priests it is still considered to be an undignified position for a man. The High Priestesses are the matrons of the Aurumian faith. They command great respect from the citizens of the Republic and even the Senate; as while their support is not officially required to launch a new war campaign, it is still unwise to do so."

In provinces where a Senate is established and maintained, Magistrates may be promoted to a higher office with more power and subsequently more responsibility. As the Republic grows so will its bureaucratic apparatus, and once a sufficient number of Magistrates are elevated to a higher rank, a Census will be held across the Republic, and a specialized office opened in the capital to keep track of the exact number of subjects in all the Republic's provinces.
Corrupt and vile men Magistrates advance just as often as those more capable and honest. Maybe it is due to their unscrupulousness that they are able to manipulate others into placing them into positions of power."

Decadence and indulgence is wide-spread in the Republic of Aurum and the patrician class. The influence that such citizens have on the Republic and the plebeian class can often be substantial, especially if the individual in question is a High Magistrate. However, the moral decline of the Republic can also produce wonders, quite literally, if there is a capable enough architect to bring to life the decadent dreams of High Magistrates."

#descr "In the Republic's capital city a towering giant cast out of pure gold reaches towards the skies and stands vigil. The monument is estimated to be hundreds of feet tall and its mesmerizing shine in full sunlight can even be seen from surrounding lands hundreds of leagues away. The Golden Hoplite is a testament to the Republic's vast power, but more importantly its renewed decadence and indolence as the wealth spent to erect the this golden colossus is all but immeasurable. Though the Republic seemingly grows greater day by day, the constant expansionist politics and wealth-seeking conquests needed to indulge such material frivolity are putting the Republic in grave danger."

During the coming years, two of the three great Consuls passed away and were from then on replaced by regular, yearly votes that elevated two Senators to the rank of the Consul via a democratic vote for a period of exactly one year that would serve to limit any potential accumulation of power and return to tyranny. However, as the long years passed, the most deserving of the three original Consuls continued to linger, seemingly unaffected by age. Soon he was named the Golden Consul for years in office brought the golden age of Aurum. Though the Golden Consul is credited as being the most famed general and tactician to have ever been born in Aurum, and a masterful magistrate and politician to boot, he has long-since willingly reclused himself from the Republic's affairs, rarely even choosing to venture out into the public's eye. Those more skeptical citizens speculate that the Golden Consul's retirement from political office and his unwillingness to command legions was secretly imposed by the Senate, worried that the first son of the Republic might eventually become its first Emperor were his influence left to spread to openly.
In the later years, the Golden Consul has in a sense become something of a spiritual protector of the Republic, eternal as long as the Republic yet lives."

While they are not as cruel or homicidal, they are far more easily ruled by emotions such as jealousy, greed or hatred. Blade Dancers are fierce Dark Elf warriors. Instead of adopting the classical sword techniques of the Dark Elves they have rather invented their own unique blend of skills. They whirls around the battlefield in a flurry of motion hacking and slashing all the while. A Blade Dancer in battle is a thing terrifying to behold, though decidedly seductive."

However that did not stop the society and indeed his father from ostracizing him so he was cast into the very dredges of society along with whores, cowards and slaves. The harsh life he endured has made him tough and crueler beyond even the most vicious of the Dark Elves. Being only a half-breed Feradel is not as frail of constitution as other Dark Elves but nor is he as long lived. Over the years he has discovered ways to extend his life by dabbling in Blood magic and stealing the life force of other beings to sustain himself. Since, he has discovered other dark secrets that have made him feared and loathed in Azarien. A sure sign of greatness indeed."

Fearful of the giant and driven by hate of everything that is different than them, the people of the village enslaved Goliath and put him to intense manual labor. Over the long years of mistreatment Goliath became cruel and hateful. And then one day the great meteor fell and Dur-Halam was set ablaze. Little is know of what transpired in the village during the confusion but one thing is certain; Goliath had broken free, slaughtered the entire village and proclaimed himself king. Goliath discarded his chains just long enough to have them tempered with the meteor metal as they serve as a harsh reminder of the true nature of men. Though Goliath is a king he commands no armies as he despises the people of Dur-Halam, but he gladly serves the God that set him free and revels in any opportunity to exact his revenge."

He burned and burned as the flames continued to lick at him but Krel did not perish. In fact, Krel has remained ablaze to this day as the meteor flames ceaselessly dance around him. Many believe him to be chosen by the meteor God and it is said that Krel's flames can not be quenched as long as the metoer God of Dur-Halam watches over him."

It is well known which parts of the forest Cohen calls his own and those wise enough avoid venturing there, lest they be mauled by wolves and bears. With the meteor-fall Cohen has decided it was time to break his isolation and venture back into civilization once more."

It is said that the first people to exhibit these peculiar powers came from the infamous slave mines of Ozidian of the eponymous kingdom, where as many as a third of the slaves would perish yearly due to hardship of the mines, and the abuse they suffers at the hands of the taskmasters. Eventually, the kingdom built upon brutality was destroyed by it, and brick by brick its existence erased from history by those who would come to call themselves Edranorians, the people of hardship in the old tongue of Ozidian. Those who live today are retold the horrors of Ozidian to imprint upon them what happens to those who are weak and who cannot endure. From a very tender age the people of Edranor are conditioned to withstands unconscionable brutality and then through sheer force of willpower use it to channel powerful magic. Using emotions to as a source of magic is exceptionally hard, and quite dangerous. Most mages spend their years perfecting but a single spell, and it can take a lifetime to fully master even the single one. Burning Warlocks are mages capable of binding and immobilize their enemies by conjuring a prison made of flames around them.

#descr "A Diviner is an mage whose fury, and thus main source of power, has subsided in their old age. Their fragile bodies no longer allow these mages to fuel their spellcasting abilities using pain and torment, for while their spirit can still endure it, their aged bodies alas can not. However, Diviners are far from being magically impotent as they still posses vast knowledge of the arcana from their long years of spellcasting, if not the power to wield it themselves. Diviners hold a rare privilege in Edranor society for being allowed to retain honorary positions of those they once held in the hierarchy rightfully, but could hold no more due to the burden old age has placed upon their powers. Most of their time is no occupied by aiding the theoretical research of ascendance, but also by scrying the lands neighboring their deserts, for reliable scouts are a commodity not afforded to Edranor."

Having the mental fortitude to weave complex spell or rituals both while harnessing emotions such as pain and rage, while also containing the adverse effect they impose is no small feat. In fact, the mages of Edranor spend their entire lives training to draw upon such emotions and continue to hold a sufficient presence of mind to spellcast to the point of death. Since such emotions are not so easily spurred on at a moment's notice, most Edranorians rely on the sympathetic links they form with the Mana Vortex to be able to cast spell at all times.
Sometimes though, a careless mage can get overwhelmed by the link and draw too much from it to the point where they are no longer able to stop channeling and their magic starts to consume and burn them from the inside. Though those who fall into this trapping will for a brief time experience a profound surge of power, doing such a thing is a guaranteed death sentence.
A Diviner in his ardent form will gain +1 to all magic paths during battle, but will take 1AN dmg capped each combat round until he dies. Even if the Diviner doesn't die during battle, he will still be killed as soon as it ends. Upon death, the mage will explode in an AoE 1 effect."

#descr "A Diviner is an mage whose fury, and thus main source of power, has subsided in their old age. Their fragile bodies no longer allow these mages to fuel their spellcasting abilities using pain and torment, for while their spirit can still endure it, their aged bodies alas can not. However, Diviners are far from being magically impotent as they still posses vast knowledge of the arcana from their long years of spellcasting, if not the power to wield it themselves. Diviners hold a rare privilege in Edranor society for being allowed to retain honorary positions of those they once held in the hierarchy rightfully, but could hold no more due to the burden old age has placed upon their powers. Most of their time is no occupied by aiding the theoretical research of ascendance, but also by scrying the lands neighboring their deserts, for reliable scouts are a commodity not afforded to Edranor."

#descr "Though they are no longer of Edranor, some Ascendants still choose to linger for a time. Perhaps due to the bonds they once used to share with the people of this land, and that might still mean something to the ascended beings. Or perhaps out of simple curiosity, for they seem to retain little of their former personalities and sense of self. While the Ascendants are revered and their presence valued, they are also a source of constant frustration, as Ascendants are wholly alien in the way they perceive reality or how they communicate, and are often of little to no help when it comes to understanding ascension and how they achieved it. When asked to explain the process of ascension, they would answer in incomprehensible riddles that would spark frustrating philosophical debate that ultimately lead nowhere.
'Evoke the spheres and consume their shinning lights.' they'd simply say, and considered the matter closed. Every question posed would receive a similarly incoherent response from every Ascendant, and every answer a new dozen questions.
Similarly to Ardent Mages, the Ascendants also appear as beings woven out of pure astral flames, but unlike them are in essence immortal, unfettered by their previous life and able to change their nebulous form to whatever is most suiting at the moment. Their understanding of the universe far surpasses that of other beings as death and dying are seemingly meaningless terms to them. Ascendants are magic incarnate and can simply reform themselves at will in any of the plains of existence when the need arises."

#descr "Though each of the Three Pyramids of Edranor are a marvel to behold, the Gleaming Pyramid is certainly the most awe-inspiring, assuming one could even gaze at it long enough to fully take in and appreciate its beauty without going blind, a daunting act nearly worth the risk. Chiseled to perfection, its gleaming surface made of gemstones seems to capture flames within it, giving it a radiant look and the appearance of flames flowing across its surface. The Gleaming Pyramids exudes such heat that the very air around it distorts, shimmers and burns the lungs of those who inhale it while the sand upon which it stands melts and turns to glass. Much like the other two Pyramids, the Gleaming Pyramid too has slowly started to develop a will of its own and powers to rival that of pretender gods. Endowed with the blazing fury of the Edranorians, the pyramid is capable of conjuring a vast prison of flame and enwebbing and subduing entire armies.
The Gleaming Pyramid will cast a battle-wide Prison of Fire on the enemy army at the start of each battle."

#descr "The people of Edranor have developed a certain level of artistry when it comes to carving out stone monuments, even if their purpose for doing so isn't merely artistic expression. Even those which are rough-hewn still hold a certain allure with their irregular contours and neatly inscribed sigils. Unlike those, the Three Pyramids are created as both works of art and sophisticated magical construct.
The Obsidian Pyramid is carved out of smooth, iridescent obsidian and stores a powerful magical focus at its center. Designed to absorb both the souls and magic of countless mages, the Obsidian Pyramid has started to develop a will of its own over time, and is slowly growing to rival the powers of god-like entities. Endowed with the iron will of the Edranorians, the Obsidian Pyramid is able to dominate the minds of those around itself.
The Obsidian Pyramid will autocast an AoE 15 Communion Slave spell around itself at the beginning of each battle."

Filled with an insatiable craving for knowledge and power born of hatred, the Sanguine Pyramid will continue to gorge itself on the life-force of all those around it, regardless of allegiance, for it represents naught but wanton destruction and an infinite thirst for power. By gormandizing the life-force and magic of countless beings the Sanguine Pyramid has developed a will of its own and an aspiration to consume everything.
The Sanguine Pyramid will cast Bloodletting which will impact 10% of the battlefield each combat round with a MR negates easily roll."

They've discovered a completely new and before unthought of form of magic. Countless little rituals, spells, incantations and constructs have been devised and created, and even significant progress into ascension has been made. All of this has been made significantly easier - though far from easy - by the existence of the Pillars of Knowledge. These monolithic slabs of stones have been overlain with countless intricate magical symbols interlaced is such a way to form a complex magical weave which significantly eases the study of the arcane by exuding a soothing aura on the mind and helping those near it focus on their research more easily."

Of those who live there, most are occupied with unlocking their magical abilities or the study of the arcane. As such Edranorians frequently lack the manpower needed for many otherwise common duties, such as guard or patrol duties. It is for this purpose that the Pillars of Vigils exist. These pillars are inscribed with sigils of warding which can sense those with ill-intent from leagues away, and focus powerful stellar rays on them capable of burning them to cinder."

The strange powers granted to this towering pillar by the mages of Edranor allow it to draw upon the magic of the Spheres and transmute it into a small amount of riches in the form of magic pearls and gold ore. These pillars are quite invaluable to the people of Edranor who do not produce much on their own, despite living in an ore rich region with already existing mining infrastructure. The gems are utilized for rituals and inquiries into ascension, while the gold is used to trade with those few and spread out villages willing to do so with the infamous people of Edranor.
A Pillar of Plenty will generate anywhere between one to three Astral gems, and ten to thirty gold per month. This effect will not be visible in either the nation's gem or gold income."

These ritual are the cornerstone on which the entire society of Edranor is built upon. They serve to cull the weak and powerless and help shape and expand the minds of those who remain. Such a cruel way of life can leave many marks on those who manage to survive childhood, for indeed many do not make it. Few are those among these hardened people of the desert who bear no mark of strife. It is for this reason that the Pillars of Endurance are erected and inscribed with magical symbols of healing, for without it many would remain crippled for life. A fate much less terrible in Edranor than in other places, but one best avoided. With time, a Pillar of Ednurance with heal even the most persistent of wound, and leave little trace of the abuse suffered during childhood, at least physically."

#descr "Edranorians have long since discovered that, with some effort, they can manifest their powers in a great vortex of swirling energy. However, as their primary source of power comes from deeply negative emotions such as hate, rage, and torment, it comes as no surprise that the manifestation of those powers is frightfully unstable, tempestuous, and prone to violent discharges of energy. Despite the inherent risks of creating a Mana Vortex and one becoming untethered, they are still the primary tool of the Edranorians, for they allow them to draw upon the vortex's endless well of emotions at all times so that they are never left powerless. In order to stabilize the volatile and fluctuating magic of a Mana Vortex and keep it from annihilating everything for leagues around itself in a violent discharge of energy, an Arcane Anchor is needed. Should the anchor be destroyed the Mana Vortex will flare up and explode before a new anchor can be created."

Rather they are sommonfolk who simply seek to earn respite from the hard toil of their day to day lives and perhaps even a little extra coin or food by joining an army. Hunting and games of archery are both popular amongst the commonfolk of Bretonnia and the bow is a common weapon of community defence, as even simple weapons such as spears are forbidden to those who are not Men-at-Arms. Consequently mobs of bowmen are quick and easy to gather should a Lord require them, though they are such a disorganised and foolish rabble that no noble would even try to issue them orders on the battlefield."

One of the most common routes to the status of Yeomen is brave service and experience in the Men-at-Arms, though this comes at considerable risk. Yeoman soldiers are better trained, better equipped, and more dedicated in battle than any Man-at-Arms and while they are by no means respected by the knights, they are trusted to give a good enough account of themselves. They are quite often used to guard forts and castles and are experienced in defending such structures."

Longbowmen pick out new recruits to the Yeoman soldiery who and induct them into the use of the Longbow, a much more powerful bow than any a peasant would be allowed for hunting or the like. Longbow units tend to be quite well drilled, as they are given dispensation to practice as a group on a routine basis, setting aside the usual labour required of them. Consequently the position of Yeoman Longbowman is a coveted one, as it represents one of the best lots in life in which a commoner can find himself."

#descr "All noble sons of Bretonnia are committed to the path of knighthood from the moment they are born, but while their noble blood ensures them a place amongst the aristocracy, a young noble will not be honoured until he has proven himself. Knights Errant are the youngest Knights with the most to prove, known for their brash arrogance, thirst for glory, and impetuous nature. They rarely listen to orders and indeed it is rather expected that they should not, for no knight should stand to be without honour and the surest way to earn it is in a headlong charge into the foe. Some Lords see the reckless charge of the Errants to be a necessary way of pruning the ranks, others simply a suitable outlet for the insecurity and enthusiasm of youth, but none would deny a young knight his chance at destiny. Bretonnian knights are provided with fine arms and armour by their family holdings, many passed down for generations, and as such put little burden for precious resources on the nation. They ride purebreed Destriers that are amongst the finest steeds in the world and selectively bred to easily support the weight of an armoured rider."

That said it is impressed on every knight that they are no lesser than their mounted fellows for fighting on foot and can and must seek their destiny in battle, so Knights Errant remain just as impetuous and uncontrollable even when fighting on foot.

They are granted a small fief from within their family's holdings, or, in rare cases, from land personally controlled by a Lord or Duke. Just as the peasants living in the fief then owe their fealty to the knight, the knight owes his to his Lord. It is a common saying that the Knights of the Realm are the shield of Bretonnia, but in battle they act more like its armoured fist, punching directly through the enemy line and shattering their forces. Knights of the Realm are expected to personally deal with lesser threats to their fief and are well practiced at rooting out hidden foes or troublemakers.

#descr "The greatest honour that any noble of Bretonnia can receive is to drink from the Grail and receive the blessing of the Lady. This honour calls out to a great many nobles and to resist the call, once it comes, is to invite an existence tortured by doubt and regret, to forever more ask 'what if?'. No matter how wealthy, influential, or powerful the noble there is only one way to receive a blessing from the Grail and that is to take the Questing Vow, leaving behind both lands and lance. Questing Knights roam the lands with very few possessions seeking out danger and adventure to prove themselves worthy of the Grail. Their quests are typically long and dangerous, often ending in failure and as nearly likely to end in the death of the noble. Questing Knights are well known for their thirst for glory and often seek to fell the largest beasts on the battlefield with great two handed swords designed explicitly to cut down large foes. Having given up the trappings of nobility their upkeep is only a quarter of that required by a Knight of the Realm."

Their numbers are made of exclusively of Knights of the Realm, usually those from with particularly influential or wealthy fiefs, as a battle trained pegasus is a highly expensive and prestigious mount. That said, a pegasus is no mere status symbol, for they are stronger and faster than even the finest Destrier and their ability to take flight with a knight upon their back makes them incredibly useful in war. Bretonnian knights are provided with fine arms and armour by their family holdings, many passed down for generations, and as such put little burden for precious resources on the nation. Should the Pegasus Knight be slain in battle his loyal mount will fight on to avenge him before flying back to its ancestral mountain home."

Few indeed reach this pinnacle of virtue and only those with a pure an unblemished soul survive the experience, with those with even the slightest blemish to their honour are merely granted peaceful death. From that moment on the knight takes up a new vow, to serve the Lady and the Grail, and becomes something more than a mortal man. Grail Knights are sworn to defend the sacred places of the Lady, be they chapels, lakes, or simple woodland groves, and they will only leave these sites to take up war when the wider realm is truly threatened. To the commonfolk of Bretonnia the Grail Knights form a pantheon of living deities, an impossibly perfect ideal which uplifts and gives purpose to their life simply by existing, and long after a Grail Knight falls in battle his name will be remembered by the peasantry and repeated like a prayer against evil. Bretonnian knights are provided with fine arms and armour by their family holdings, many passed down for generations, and as such put little burden for precious resources on the nation. They ride purebreed Destriers that are amongst the finest steeds in the world and selectively bred to easily support the weight of an armoured rider."

#descr "The commonfolk of Bretonnia have very few rights and many of the circumstances of their lives are dictated by what they are forbidden to do, as these acitvities are reserved as privileges of the nobility. Peasants may not wear bright colours, live in houses with more than two floors, or even travel freely beyond their village without explicit permission from the ruler of their fief. The exception to the law of travel comes in the case of a pilgrimage, as none can be denied the right to travel to a chapel or other sacred place of the Lady to seek her blessing. As such pilgrimages are popular even with less religious sorts, although almost inevitably many of those who engage in them find their faith greatly increased by both their company and the holy sites they witness. Occasionally pilgrims will be so taken with religious fervour that they seek the chance to take vengeance on the enemies of the Lady. They make poor fighters and because of the strict rules around pilgrimage are armed only with walking sticks and a handful of stones, but their fanaticism lends them courage in battle, though making them rather difficult to control. Pilgrims will gather at temples, particularly those within strong dominion, and await an army to join."

They are aware that by doing so they risk the deserved wrath of the nobility, ostracision from their fellow commoners, and gruesome death on the field of battle, but so strong is their hatred of those who would dare stand against the Lady and harm the defenders of Bretonnia that they can see no other path. Some Battle Pilgrims were once pilgrims who found a taste for war, others are the survivors of villages destroyed by marauders, and others still are those who saw knights heroically fighting to defend the realm and were overcome by religious rapture. These men are usually the veterans of many battles, for those who are unworthy are quickly slain, and make surprisingly effective infantry. The knights of Bretonnia regard Battle Pilgrims with a mixture of scorn and revulsion, but it is clear that the Lady has some plan for them, for her advocates not only tolerate them to exist but are known to bless them as sacred warriors."

While knights are supposed to seek glory and demonstrate valour, they are also expected to be men of eloquence and refinement in high social circles, and it is in this realm that the Courtiers hold the most sway. These nobles are disdained by their martial brethren but feared for their influence and skill in politicking and talent for inflicting public humiliation on any noble who tries to shame them for their lack of battle honours.

#name "Grail Paladin"
#descr "Those Paladins who set aside their duties and take the Questing Vow usually end up either abandoning their Quest and retiring back to their former status, or more likely losing their lives in heroic battle against some violent evil, be it mundane or supernatural. Very few ever find the Grail and even then some do not survive drinking from it, but those that do are known as Grail Paladins and are amongst the greatest warriors mankind has ever produced. Like Grail Knights they swear the Grail Oath to service of the Lady rather than any Lord, Duke, or even the King, but in times of war when the nation is threatened they make for powerful assets in the armies of Bretonnia."

#descr "Lords are nobles who hold a high station in the social hierarchy of Bretonnia and as such command the fealty of many Knights of the Realm. While each knight is expected to tend to his own fief and Lords are no exception their personal fiefs are usually much larger and they also have the authority to oversee the fiefs of all the Knights of the Realm sworn to them. Because of the Bretonnian emphasis on martial greatness Lords tend to be superb warriors in their own right, often having reached their higher status through glorious deeds on the battlefield. They owe their fealty to Dukes, who are to Lords what Lords are to Knights of the Realm, though some Lords are sufficiently powerful that even their Duke would have to present their wishes as requests rather than commands. As with other knights they provide their own arms and armour and ride upon purebreed Destriers that are easily able to convey a heavily armoured rider."

#descr "All Bretonnian Lords bear a greater responsibility than the Knights of the Realm who swear fealty to them, for their holdings consist of many fiefs and the lives of other nobles, not just commonfolk, are in their hands. Even so they are knights themselves and no-one, not even the King, can deny a knight his destiny. So it is that some Lords, even rulers of many decades, may receive a vision from the Lady, set aside their duties, and take the Questing Vow. Questing Knights are expected to live on the road and forego most of the luxuries of nobility and as such require only a quarter of the usual upkeep."

Each of the Dukes is a mighty hero, having ascended to their position not only by birthright but by countless great and honourable deeds, and many of them have successfully completed the Questing Vow and become Grail Lords, taking back their title to protect all of the sacred sites within their Dukedom. By honouring their acheivements with a tournament, great hunt, feast day, or other ritual, one of the Dukes will be entreated to join your cause along with some troops.
[When you hire this commander you will receive, at the end of the turn, a randomly selected one of 12 unique Dukes which vary in power but are all stronger than a Lord commander. You will also receive assorted troops depending on which Duke you get. If you have already had all 12 Dukes, you'll get a Grail Lord and some troops instead. This can only happen if you still control the province in which the Duke was recruited, so if you are put under siege the Entreat Duke icon will remain until the province is back under your control, at which point you will get a Duke and troops as normal]"

Bohemond's fame is hard to overstate: he is worshipped by the peasantry as a living god and held up as an ideal of the Questing Vow by almost every knight in the Kingdom. His greatest acheivement, for which he was granted the prize of the Grail, was the slaying of the dragon Smearghus, from whose bones he crafted his signature mace and whose scales were used to forge his armour. Bohemond, for all his martial prowess, has never been much of a leader of men, though his fame certainly inspires great deeds from those under his command."

Huebald is both small and slight by the standards of knights and has had to work extremely diligently to prove himself as a warrior, living a rather spartan life of training both his sword arm and his mind to better lead his Dukedom to military victory. Unlike some other Dukes Huebald never felt the call of the Questing Vow, for he was always too busy preparing for Carcassonne's next campaign against greenskins, beastmen and the like. He is known as a superb leader of men particularly favoured by the peasantry, for while he shows them no more compassion than most, he recognises their utility on the battlefield and is loathe to misuse any tactical asset. Huebald is brutally honest about his own strengths and weaknesses and eschews the use of a lance, as he does not regard his best place as being at the head of a charging formation of knights."

As a warrior, though, there are few who can match the thickly muscled Duke of Artois. Should the enemy survive his initial charge, Chilfroy will lay waste to the survivors with a deadly magical axe he reclaimed from a Beastlord he slew singlehanded."

#descr "Alberic is the Duke of Bordeleaux, a powerful Dukedom famed for its wine, craftsmen, and large sea-ports. Dukes of Bordeleaux follow the Virtue of Discipline and are known to be sharp-minded and pragmatic rulers, often closely advising the King himself. Alberic is a highly capable commander and particularly well known for both the quality of his Knights of the Realm and his clever use of Yeoman soldiers, drawing on the comparatively better off commonfolk of his wealthy Dukedom. He believes strongly in the cause of Bretonnia and will donate gold from his personal coffers each month to support the war effort. In battle the Duke wields the magical Trident of Manann, which grants both him and a small force of troops the ability to travel underwater."

Dukes of Montfort follow the Virtue of Empathy, championing the commonfolk and receiving their loyalty and adoration in return. Folcard is perhaps the most beloved ruler in Bretonnia, at least amongst his own subjects, for he takes the practice of knightly compassion and empathy for lessers far more seriously than most of his fellow nobles. He cares deeply about the plight of his people and has even set up a system of signal beacons such that knights can quickly respond to threats to even remote villages. Folcard is well known for his ability to quickly organise provincial defences and the loyalty and comparative bravery displayed by commoners under his command."

Dukes of Quenelles follow the Virtue of Purity and are known for their honour and steadfast efforts to destroy the enemies of mankind. Tancred II is the son of one of the most revered Dukes and Grail Knights in Bretonnian history who lost his life at the hands of Heinrich Kemmler, the Lichemaster. Seeking to honour his father Tancred II swore to drive both the undead and greenskin blights from all Bretonnian lands and has led many campaigns to that goal. A highly skilled and honourable warrior in his own right, Tancred II followed in his father's footsteps by seeking and drinking from the Grail and also recovered the mighty magic weapon the Star of Quenelles, with which he smites evil from the world."

#descr "Bretonnia is a land which places a heavy slate of duties, restrictions, and laws upon its people, especially commonfolk and women. However there is one occupation that is, due to unusual laws of unknown origin but clear legal authority, almost entirely outside these restrictions: that of the Shepherdess. Women who tend to sheep may, so long as they are actively doing their job, travel, own armour, earn and keep money, and even take part in battles. Consequently some women who seek freedom and find they have a talent for war effectively become mercenaries, though they must maintain the charade that they are merely tending to sheep. This suits the nobility rather well as while they are forbidden from hiring mercenaries, they are quite within their rights to hire Shepherdesses to escort a single sheep right to the site of a battle and through enemy lines. When a Shepherdess Commander is recruited she will bring fifteen of her Shepherdess 'assistants' with her. They are disciplined fighters, well armoured under their rustic smocks, and armed with staff slings which they use to great effect at range and in melee."

#name "Battle Reliquae"
#descr "To some peasants Grail Knights are effectively living gods whose every act is one of divine heroism and every word is scripture, thus it is unsurpising that there is a particular set of Pilgrims who dedicate their lives to following Grail Knights and, should they meet their end, rushing to secure holy 'relics'. If a Grail Knight is unlucky to be felled in a remote place and this news reaches these fanatics before any members of the nobility, it is quite possible the remains of both knight and steed will be stolen away and turned into a Battle Reliquae. Battle Reliquaes are effectively the skeletal remains of a Grail Knight and his trusty steed dressed up and held together by bindings and staves in a parody of life. They are carried into battle by devout bands of Pilgrims who are driven into a frenzy by visions of their fallen hero-god looking over their actions and approving. Inevitably the presence of a Reliquae causes unrest in the population of a province as commoners argue over the wishes and possession of the remains. The nobility, especially those who have taken the Grail Vow, regard Reliquaes with disgust bordering on horror, but the emissaries of the Lady have let it be known that they are to be allowed to accompany armies into battle and the nobility have no choice but to accept their presence with gritted teeth.

This is likely because they do not show such clear signs of magical talent or the touch of the Fae, as it is certainly the case that Maidens are considerably less gifted in the sorcerous arts than their superiors. It is not unheard of for even peasant girls to be selected as Maidens, a fact which somewhat salves the displeasure a farmer or labourer will feel at the news his newborn child is not a son."

Damsels specialise in enhancing the power of knights, particularly the Grail Knights that serve them, on the field of battle, but they also wield considerable political power, as no Lord would ignore their counsel.

#name "Green Knight"
#descr "The Green Knight is the sacred protector of Bretonnia, and his spirit-essence is intertwined with the land and the Lady of the Lake. As the Champion of the Lady he has tested many Questing Knights, facing them in duels to assess their worth to sip from the Grail, sometimes even slaying those who are truly unworthy of this final test. Amongst evil creatures like Beastmen and Greenskins the Green Knight is greatly feared, for he is a merciless and relentless slayer of such filth, capable of bursting forth from the bole of ancient trees, springing from still lakes, or galloping out from behind waterfalls to wreak his terrible vengeance against interlopers to the realm of the Lady. Bretonnians dare not ascribe a name to this figure but in the foul tongue of the Beastmen he is known as 'Shaabhekh', or Soul Killer. Weapons have little effect on the Green Knight. Some say that blades and arrows pass straight through him as though he were as insubstantial as morning mist, while in other stories, even the most grievous of wounds inflicted upon him have virtually no effect. In one epic tale, a Questing Knight cut the Green Knight's head clean from his shoulders, but the fey being simply picked up his head and rode away. What the Green Knight actually is has been much debated, and no one in Bretonnia, save perhaps the Fay Enchantress, knows the truth. Some believe that he is the spirit of Bretonnia given physical form, while others whisper that he is Gilles le Breton himself, having devoted himself completely to the land and the Lady after he was taken from this world. Many times the Green Knight has disappeared, often after falling in battle, only to reappear some time later, for as long as Bretonnia stands she will have her protector."

#descr "A figure of awe and inspiration, the Fay Enchantress is the personal representative of the Lady of the Lake and as such is the most influential figure in Bretonnia. All Grail Knights are sworn to her service and even Kings must bow to her commands. The Fay Enchantress personally takes the noble daughters who become Damsels and Prophetesses and in cases where there is no clear successor, will select the new monarch. The current Enchantress is known as Morgiana and while there have been Enchantresses before her, in truth there is but a single spirit reincarnated in a different body the moment her previous form perishes. The Enchantress is a being of incredible magical ability, stunning beauty, and sudden spite, making her one of the most terrifyingly powerful beings in the known world. On the relatively rare occasions she takes to the battlefield she does so atop a mighty Unicorn 'Silvaron', perhaps the noblest of its kind outside of Athel Loren. The Enchantress carries the fabled Chalice of Potions which allows her to cast spells at a faster rate than mortal mages, wears the Girdle of Gold which protects her from harm, and is accompanied by a magical toad from which she can draw arcane power, said to be a former noble who greatly displeased her."

#descr "The King of Bretonnia is the highest authority within the feudal order, a position accountable only to the highest emissaries of the Lady, such as the Fay Enchantress. Kings are almost always selected from amongst the ranks of the Dukes or the direct male heir of the former King, though it is not unknown for a particularly heroic noble to be chosen by the Fay Enchantress, whose word is absolute. The current King of Bretonnia is Louen Leoncoeur, also Duke of Couronne, a heroic leader regarded as the greatest since Gilles the Uniter himself. Louen's bravery, honour, and talent for diplomacy are famed across the Old World and it is whispered that he not only drank from the Grail but was granted a kiss by the Lady of the Lake. Certainly he seems to benefit from blessings even greater than those of other Grail Lords, as he is able to heal from nearly any wound and is surrounded by an even more powerful aura of splendor. Louen rides into battle atop his ferocious Hippogryph 'Beaquis', an especially loyal and powerful example of its kind, and is armed with the ancestral Sword of Couronne and the Lion's Shield, which grants him incredible resistance to hostile magic. On his brow rests the Crown of Bretonnia, worn by every King since Gilles the Uniter, which inspires those under his command to great deeds."

#descr "Repanse de Lyonesse was once a humble shepherdess, though one of notably devout faith in the Lady. Her village was attacked and laid waste by Chaos raiders split off from a great horde besieging Couronne and when Repanse returned from the pastures she found nothing but ruin and death. At this dark moment she received a vision from the Lady telling her to take up arms and rid her land of these interlopers so she donned the armour from a fallen knight, took an ancient blade from the reliquary of the wrecked Grail Chapel, and fastened a tapestry bearing the Fleur de Lys to a lance. When the wounded and scattered knights saw a single Damsel setting out to fight the forces of Chaos they felt shamed and honour bound to follow her to death or glory. Since that time Repanse has become one of the greatest heroes of Bretonnia and has consistently shown the favour of the Lady. She is surrounded in battle by an dazzling aura of light and both her sword and makeshift banner offer protection from hostile magic to her and any who follow.

Like the other knights of Repanse's army, he placed himself in her service in recognition of her strong association with the Lady of the Lake. Having received the blessing of the Grail the already mighty knight augmented his great physical strength with supernatural prowess and in service of the Damsel of War Repanse de Lyonesse he has proved himself to be one of the greatest warriors the world has ever seen. Henri wields a magical sword enchanted to slay great beasts, protects himself with a shield blessed to repel cowardly projectile attacks, and wears thick plate armour. Henri is an imposing figure and an inspiration to others, but has little interest in military leadership, leaving this to Repanse and her advisors."

#descr "Mallobaude, often called the Black Knight, is the first Bretonnian in generations to present a serious chance of returning the lost and cursed Dukedom of Mousillon to proper rule. Mallobaude's career as a knight thusfar has been spectacular; as a Knight Errant he won glory leading a group in the Border Princes, swiftly became a Knight of the Realm and immediately took the Questing Vow. Despite many victories over foul creatures and countless heroic deeds, Mallobaude did not receive a vision of the Grail and began to despair that he had somehow lost his way. He realised he had been pursuing greatness for its own sake and, as penance, rode alone to Mousillon to face the suicidal task of cleansing that land. What happened there is unclear, but after many battles Mallobaude emerged carrying the banner of Mousillon and announced he would soon be known as its Duke, drawing many knights to support him in this crusade. While Mallobaude is a highly impressive, his association with Mousillon, unusual outcome of his Questing Vow, and rumours that he is the illegitimate son of King Louen have cast something of a shadow over his status. Indeed it is whispered amongst the peasantry that even the emissaries of the Lady are not keen to meet his piercing gaze, though no nobles would publicly countenance such nonsense."

Dreadspears tend to consider themselves true soldiers rather than arrogant warriors or crazed sadists, favouring discipline and a cold methodical slaughter of the foe before them. Though they cannot boast the incredibly well drilled and harmonised formations of their hated cousins the High Elves, Dreadspears nonetheless represent a bastion of bristling spearpoints that is near impossible for the rank and file of other forces to overwhelm."

Darkshards are named for their use of the deadly Naggarothi repeater crossbow, an advanced steel design capable of redrawing and firing from a rack of bolts far faster than a traditional crossbow. The Dark Elves see no dishonour in the use of ranged weapons and those in the Darkshards find the slaughter of foes from a distance just as sadistically satisfying as they would spilling blood with a blade up close. Typically having had decades of practice and blessed with the superior vision of their kind, every Darkshard is a frighteningly accurate marksman by the standards of other, lesser races."

The Cold Ones they have made their mounts are famously vicious and aggressive creatures and breaking them in requires considerable force of will. The Cold Ones of Naggaroth are related to the very similar beasts used as mounts by the Saurus of Lustria, but are swifter, lighter and without the ability to exude a substance which causes rapid healing. In fact these creatures from the caves under Hag Graef instead exude a noxious substance that can permanently ruin the senses of touch, smell, and taste that many decadent Dark Elves prize beyond all else, another demonstration of the discipline and single minded ambition of their riders. Should the knight fall in battle their mount can be relied upon to continue fighting for a time, though after battle they will quickly escape."

#name "Cold One Dreadknight"
#descr "Dreadknights are the wealthiest and most feared members of the Cold Ones Knights a city or Black Ark can field; nobles who have amassed such glory and plunder in their time as knights that they could easily have become Masters or attained similarly powerful positions outside of the military, but who have instead chosen to continue their grim work on the battlefield. For some it is simply that their exposure to the noxious slime of the Cold Ones has entirely destroyed their finer senses and they can now find only sadistic joy in the bloody chaos of war, for others they seek to reach the position of Dreadlord through martial glory, while others still are biding their time in the knowledge that their enemies within Dark Elf society still hold power and would end their lives if they rose too high. Dreadknights are treated with considerable respect, bordering on reverence, by most Dark Elf warriors, for they represent an ideal of ambition, superiority, discipline, and martial skill. Dreadknights have access to the best arms and armour available, ride upon the finest Cold One steeds, and even armour their mounts in elaborately wrought overlapping plates. Should the knight fall in battle their mount can be relied upon to continue fighting for a time, though after battle they will quickly escape."

#name "Witch Elf"
#descr "Witch Elves are the cruellest of all their heartless race, for they live only to serve Khaine's malevolent demands for bloody sacrifice. Their observances to the God of Murder are blood slicked affairs where the suffering of the victim and the sadistic glee of the Witch Elf are of paramount importance. Yet ceremonies are but part of the Witch Elves' worship, for the truest dedications to Khaine must take place on the battlefield that is his true domain. On the eve of war Witch Elves drink blood laced with secret herbs which grants them the ability to fly into a near uncontrolled frenzy when wounded or blessed, giving little thought to their own defence as they seek to cause the utmost slaughter in the name of their master. Witch Elves enter battle armed with paired blades dipped in poisonous oils and wear very little in the way of armour, as they are expected to offer their own bodies, blood, and suffering to Khaine willingly. Worship of Khaine is the state religion of the Dark Elves and Witch Elves are considered sacred."

#name "Harpy"
#descr "Harpies are vile and sadistic creatures that make their nests in the uppermost spires of Karond Kar. Some claim that they are the souls of slain Witch Elves given physical form, others contend that they are a manifestation of Khaine's cruelty, while scholars tend to regard them as some form of Chaos tainted mutant elf. Whatever the truth of the matter, they are considered to be a good omen in Naggarothi lore and it is widely believed by the inhabitants of Karond Kar that should they ever leave the city would soon fall. Harpies are similar in temperament to Dark Elves in the sense that they love to torment their prey, but they lack any of the accompanying discipline or dark nobility. Physically they appear as a cross between a bestial Dark Elf and some foul scavenging bird with razor sharp talons. Despite their humanoid appearance they possess a mind only raised slightly above the level of an animal and have no concept of the use of tools, instead fighting unarmoured in great shrieking mobs that descend upon vulnerable foes. Unless wrangled and threatened by a Beastmaster they are unlikely to stick around in a tough battle, but are at least capable of following a basic battle plan through some instinctual understanding of how to coordinate with Dark Elf forces."

#descr "Har Ganeth is the spiritual centre of Khaine's worship, with many shrines to the God of Murder and a skyline dominated by the massive Great Temple of Khaine. It is from Har Ganeth that Hellebron rules over the Witch Elves and countless slaves are brought to the city to be sacrificed to Khaine. Many of these sacrifices are performed by the Witch Elves and Death Hags, but after particularly great victories Har Ganeth hosts ritual mass executions in which prisoners of war are decapitated and their heads cast down the steps of the Great Temple. These executions are performed by the feared Executioners of Har Ganeth, whose loyalty is to the city and to Khaine rather than the reigning Crone Hellebron. Executioners have embraced discipline and efficiency, seeing the excesses and cruelty of the Witch Elves as needless and indulgent; a poor tribute to the true will of the God of Murder. Each Executioner strides to battle well armoured, their face hidden behind a skull like visage, and armed with a long two handed blade known as a Draich, the ceremonial weapon of his calling. Each Draich is subtly different, tailored and refined to the exact skills and preferences of its wielder, but each is as deadly as the next in the hands of its master. While Executioners are truly devoted to Khaine their cold, efficient manner and distance from the rituals of the Witch Elves means they are not seen as sacred warriors of Khaine by the populace."

#descr "The Black Guard of Naggarond are Malekith's personal army, answerable to no other save he. They are selected from birth as tribute from families high in Malekith's esteem and removed from all family bonds to be raised within the Black Towers as near unmatched warriors. The training of the Black Guard is legendarily harsh, for in addition to constant training of body and mind they are set against each other from a young age and expected to kill their classmates in order to advance and prove themselves. Malekith himself is known to lavish favour on those who show great cunning and bloodlust and once their training is complete they swear to serve for a period of no less than two centuries. Those Black Guard who survive their tour of service inevitably go on to positions of power and influence and are permitted to restore their family bonds and bring considerable favour to their clan. In battle the Black Guard march in perfect lockstep, for those who have survived the training are truly brothers, and are equipped with fine armour and great polearms which they wield with terrifying skill. Their discipline and steadfastness is famed across the world and it is said that they would rather die than break ranks or show weakness, for they know the bale eye of Malekith is always upon them."

#descr "When Malekith first learned of the Prophecy of Demise, his wrath immediately fell upon the Warlocks of Hag Graef. Interpreting the prophecy as predicting the son of a noble house would defeat him with the use of sorcery, he knew he must allow no male practicioners of magic to live freely in Naggaroth and sought to strike before the Warlocks could rebel against his rule. At this time the Warlocks were known as a great power in the land and Malekith had still not consolidated his grip beyond the city of Naggarond, so rather than pursuing military conflict he went to his mother, Morathi, and her Sorceress Convents. The Sorceresses wove a great curse that coursed through the ranks of the Warlocks, inflicting them with spiritual hollowness and marking their souls like beacons for the attention of Slaanesh. While other Elves fear the grasp of Slaanesh as a potential fate, the Warlocks could feel the Dark Prince's hunger at every moment. Though many soon fell, consumed by unholy flames, the Warlocks adapted and learned they could stall their fate by reaping souls in their stead. Doomfire Warlocks now act as mounted raiders within the Dark Elf forces, descending upon vulnerable targets to harvest souls and extend their lives. Though those amongst them with the strongest magic were quickly devoured, those that remain are known to shroud themselves in hellish flames and even project them onto their foes. Marked out as the Warlocks are for Slaanesh's delictation, those attacking them may find their weapons supernaturally turned back against them."

#descr "There are any forms of malign entertainment to be found across the cities of Naggaroth, but none are so popular as the gladiatorial arena. At sites ranging from blood spattered pits to massive amphitheatres countless lives are risked and ended for the pleasure of the crowds, the thrill of violence, and the promise of coin. Amongst those who fight voluntarily there is no group so famed or admired as the Sisters of Slaughter, originally a band of a mere dozen daughters of disgraced nobility who came together in the worship of Eldrazor, the God of Blades, that he might grant them glorious revenge. Now with their vengeance carved into the bones of those who brought their families low, the Sisters of Slaughter have thousands of members who fight at arenas across Naggaroth. Most Sisters spend their lives in gladiatorial combat in tribute to Eldrazor, but some see greater challenges lie on the battlefields of the world and join the forces of a fortunate Master or Dreadlord. In combat the Sisters wield barbed whips with impossible skill and grace, as they catch and deflect blows with bladed bucklers or simply dance through every attack their foe makes with mocking grace."

#descr "Dark Elves view all other races as inferior and fit only to be prey or toil as slaves. Dark Elves believe in committing to the pursuits of pleasure, martial glory, social status, and worship of Khaine, with all other activities considered below them, and as such their society has a constant need for slaves both economically and socially. From the doomed souls that toil deep in mines to the relatively well kept attendants of high society, from those that live only to perish in the gladiatorial arena to the countless numbers ritually sacrificed to Khaine, Dark Elf society runs on slaves. Slaves are also used in battle, driven before the Dark Elf force to absorb the impact of charges and soak up missile fire, or simply die in a way that amuses their masters. The slaves available to the military are typically those who aren't fit for other purposes and the quality will be mixed. Men from the Old World, Marauder tribesmen from the north, Goblins, and Orcs; some of them may even be slaves equipped specifically for war rather than plucked directly from the mines. Slaves are best led into battle by a Beastmaster, for Dark Elves make little distinction between animals and slaves. (If the province is attacked before they get a chance to turn into a random slave, you will get a human spear armed slave for the duration of that battle)"

#name "Orc Slave"
#descr "Orcs are commonly enslaved by Black Arks and corsair fleets that roam the world, as though they are aggressive and stubborn creatures they are numerous and hardy, both desired properties in a slave. Their brute strength, toughness, and recuperative abilities make them equally excellent labour in the pits and slave warriors on the battlefield. Orcs are heavily muscled creatures with thick bones and small brains who respect nothing more than power and like little more than to fight, even with each other. Even having been enslaved, orcs are still willing combatants, much preferring to meet their end in combat rather than in some mining accident. Orc physiology is unusual in that over time they can recover from almost any wound, even growing back missing limbs. This orc slave has recently been taken from the mines and is equipped with nothing more than a simple club, with which he will enthusiastically attack his foes."

When battle is done, Daemonettes stride amongst the fallen and bring their souls to Slaanesh's palace in the Realm of Chaos, to receive eternal pleasure or pain at the whim of their capricious master.

Fiends are rather more delicate and less physically powerful than the beasts of the other Ruinous Powers but their speed, reflexes, and armour shredding pincers make them formidable indeed, as does the poisonous stinger with which they can send their prey into a coma in which all sensation is greatly amplified. Fiends appear repulsive from a distance but when they come close they emit a musk which renders them irresistably beautiful and their movements appear so graceful that mortals have a hard time raising their weapons against them.

Steeds constantly taste the air with their long, whiplike tongues, sampling the scents and flavours of souls carried by the ever present the Winds of Magic and they are capable of hunting down almost any quarry, particularly when driven on by a Daemonette eager to deliver a new plaything to Slaanesh's embrace. In battle the claws of the Daemonette are the greatest threat presented by a Seeker, but the Steed itself carries a deadly weapon in the form of its impossibly dextrous tongue, constantly dripping poisons both deadly and psychoactive. Should the Daemonette be struck from her Steed the beast will fight on for the rest of the battle before returning to the Realm of Chaos.

#name "Marauder Hellstrider"
#descr "Hellstriders are devotees of torment, Marauders who hunt from the back of impossibly swift Daemonic Steeds of Slaanesh. These gifts from the Dark Prince come at a great price, for the Hellstrider is curse, or perhaps blessed, to feel the pain of every victim of his hunts and expected to revel in the sensations. The Steeds are said to be made from the guilty desires of living creatures and as such can never be outrun, for no being could possibly escape its own darkest yearnings; what is certainly true is that their agility and speed is far beyond that of a horse. Steeds constantly taste the air with their long, whiplike tongues, sampling the scents and flavours of souls carried by the ever present the Winds of Magic and they are capable of hunting down almost any quarry. In battle the Marauder lashes his foes with a life draining Hellscourge whip while the Steed's tongue whips out at lightning speed, delivering poisons both deadly and psychoactive. Should the Marauder be struck from his Steed the beast will fight on for the rest of the battle before returning to the Realm of Chaos."

These warriors are dedicated entirely to the pursuit of sensation and act much as an equivalent to the Witch Elves of their rival Cult, providing a fanatical and dangerous armed wing and wreaking splendid chaos for their cause. While they are as hedonistic and depraved as any in their Cult they are obsessed with the perfection of the physical form and train constantly in a peculiar, rhythmic martial art which makes use of elaborate and brutal paired weapons. They are often employed as bodyguards by those who favour the Cult."

They are just as vicious as those favoured by the Dark Elves as mounts, but more compact, heavily scaled, and arguably even more difficult to break in. Their skin oozes an unpleasant slime much like the Naggarothi Cold Ones, but it has unusual healing properties that make the beasts particularly resilient to injury. Lustrian Cold Ones are sometimes gathered and unleashed by the High Beastmasters of the Dark Elves, for they are all too willing to take out the frustrations of captivity and the lash on an unsuspecting enemy."

They move with a precision and grace that is to other elves as the elves are to lesser races and are trained to fight blindfolded, in the midst of battle, or within a closely packed crowd. The Cult of Khaine hires out Assassins at exorbitant cost to the rulers of Naggaroth, though the price may come in forms other than merely coin. Such is the fiercely competitive and ruthless nature of Dark Elf society that there is never any shortage of willing employers or dark deeds to be performed from the shadows. Assassins are masters of many forms of combat, as their sect has collected martial lore from across the world, even as far abroad as Cathay and Ind, and make extensive use of poisons and acids to immobilise, weaken, and kill their targets. Their stealth, patience, and cunning in reaching their mark is as famed as their skills in combat. As agents of Khaine they are sacred to the Dark Elves. Khainite Assassins consider the tools of their trade a holy blessing from Khaine himself and will not exchange them for other equipment - additionally because they bear the Mark of Khaine they will be blessed at all times, for their entire life is but a devotion to the God of Murder."

The bulk of these Nobles are known as Masters and it is they who lead most military forces and complete tasks for the near untouchable Dreadlords that rule over the cities and Black Arks of Naggaroth. Dark Elves abhor weakness beyond all else and while some Masters are courtly schemers and puppeteers that remain in the shadows, those that do take to the battlefield are, without exception, extremely skilled and disciplined tacticians and warriors in their own right. Masters are always well armed and armoured, outfitted by the finest craftsmen they can afford, though they must take care not to leave even the suggestion that the might be attempting to outshine any nearby Dreadlord."

#descr "Long before the Sundering split the Elves of Ulthuan into factions, the keen-eyed riders of Nagarythe kept guard against the signs of daeomonic intrusion, tirelessly seeking out the foes of their realm even in the direst of circumstances. During the civil war these same riders served Nagarythe as brutal raiders, travelling ahead of the warrior host to sow terror and confusion and break the morale of their cousins, showing them for the weak and soft people they had become. To this day Dark Riders still serve as messengers and advance forces for the great cities of Naggaroth, or are deployed to strike deep in enemy lands as harbingers of destruction. Their steeds, once purebred stock from Ulthuan, are now twisted with exposure to dark magic, though no less fleet of hoof for it. Heralds are the leaders of small Dark Rider groups, sometimes the youngest children of minor noble families, but usually Riders who have proven themselves and gained respect from their fellows as well as their superiors."

They are related to the very similar beasts used as mounts by the Saurus of Lustria, but swifter and more vicious, if less heavily scaled, and without the ability to exude a substance which causes rapid healing. They are stubborn and single minded beasts prone to bouts of blind predatory rage and stupidity and they can be relied upon to fight even after their rider has been struck down, though after battle they will quickly escape."

#name "Dreadlord"
#descr "Dreadlords are the rulers of Black Arks, fortified outposts, or entire cities of Naggaroth and represent the pinnacle of the Dark Elven ideology of ambition, ruthlessness, and strength. Even moreso than Masters they are almost exclusively from high birth, backed by powerful and influential noble families and raised from a young age with the sole purpose of ascending to the station of Dreadlord. Unlike lesser nobles there is little chance that a Dreadlord could maintain his position without being an exceptionally skilled and experienced warrior in addition to a master of intrigue and courtly affairs, as each will inevitably find themselves appraised by the cold eye of the Witch King, Malekith, whose intolerance for weakness is legendary. Becoming a Dreadlord requires not only great martial skill and a brilliant tactical and strategic mind, but ambition that borders on the megalomaniacal and an absolutely iron will. In battle Dreadlords wield the finest arms and armour and ride atop the most vicious Cold One available."

#name "Pleasure Cultist"
#descr "The Cult of Pleasure first appeared as a secret society of aristocrats, artists, poets, and politicians during the reign of Bel Shanaar, the successor to Malekith's father Aenarion. Malekith's discovery of the Cult as a front for the worship of the Chaos God Slaanesh and subsequent campaign to eradicate them played an instrumental role in the death of Bel Shanaar, the start of the Civil War and the eventual Sundering which saw the Dark Elves create a new society in exile. Seeing the machinations of Slaanesh as a threat to his power, Malekith outlawed the worship of Slaanesh across Naggaroth and established the Cult of Khaine as an official state religion. Nonetheless, secretly supported by his mother Morathi, the Cult of Pleasure has persisted. Pleasure Cultists, already skilled in manipulation and intrigue, receive further gifts of supernatural beauty and seduction from Slaanesh, and their presence decreases faith in the religion of Khaine. They have also learned rituals of blood magic quite apart from those used by the Death Hags. In any Dark Elf fortification without sufficiently strong positive dominion there is a chance that the Cult of Pleasure will take hold. This Cultist is female.

#name "Anointed of Slaanesh"
#descr "The Anointed of Slaanesh are mighty warriors and military leaders who, seduced by the Cult of Pleasure and inducted into its innermost secrets, have pledged their fealty to the Dark Prince Slaanesh in exchange for power. In some ways they are like the Chaos Champions that arise from the human tribes that live in and around the Chaos Wastes, but Elves are far more resistant to the warping ways of Chaos and they are not destined for the fate of the Chaos Spawn or Daemonhood as a Daemon Prince. Their souls will doubtless eventually be claimed by the capricious Lord of Pleasure, but for now their allegiance to the youngest of the Chaos Gods greatly enhances their senses and abilities. Anointed tower over other Elves and have incredible strength of personality and presence, in addition to supernatural beauty and grace. In battle they are both capable generals and deadly personal combatants. Their only weakness is a reduced resistance to hostile magic caused by their enhanced senses and the invisible Chaos energies constantly swirling around them."

Their grip on magical power is exacerbated by Malekith's interpretation of the Prophecy of Demise, for he believes he is the great warrior that might one day be cast from his throne by a male magic user. Initiates are the lowest ranking members of the Convent and are tasks with performing minor rituals, serving lesser nobles, and conducting much of the day to day research into the dark art of their order, though by the standards of lesser races they are still powerful mages."

#descr "The Cult of Pleasure has long been used by Morathi as a tool to further her goals and, in her twisted mind, ensure that her son Malekith fulfils his destiny and rules over Ulthuan and the world. Morathi long ago struck some manner of deal with Slaanesh and has on many occasions turned her people towards worship of the Dark Prince. It is Morathi's influence that has lead to the upper echelons of the Dark Convent experimenting with blood magic and it is thanks to her that no small number of Sorceresses have become devotees of Slaanesh. Slaaneshi Sorceresses must maintain the illusion that they are, like their fellows, loyal subjects of the Witch King that observe the official Khainite religion, but in reality they are full members of the Cult of Pleasure and have been inducted into direct worship of Slaanesh. The Dark Prince, though capricious, is a generous master and has lavished them with his blessings leaving them even more powerful than their fellows and able to seduce and corrupt others with ease. Strangely when they attempt to scry into the future, though, they see only writhing visions of Slaanesh's loving embrace."

#descr "Supreme Sorceresses are the most powerful members of the Dark Convent and boast a mastery of magic that near rivals that of Morathi herself, though they cannot match the power and dark blessings she has cultivated over the centuries. They are very few in number and only the most powerful Dreadlords can afford their services, though they are still in great demand despite the exorbitant costs involved. Often they serve either Morathi or her son the Witch King Malekith directly, though as Malekith's trust in his mother has waned he has increasingly sought control over the upper echelons of the Convent. Supreme Sorceresses alone amongst their order can openly study blood magic, for the Hags of the Cult of Khaine, save perhaps Hellebron herself, lack the authority to stop them. In addition to their staggering magical power they are talented in the use of scrying and divination and are said to be able to gaze into the future as easily as one might look to the sky. Supreme Sorceresses have such influence that even the mightiest Black Ark will make haste to ferry them wherever they wish to go."

#name "High Beastmaster"
#descr "The Beastmasters of Clar Karond and Karond Kar can command even the unruliest creatures to do their bidding. In part this mastery stems from their unflinching dedication to the tormentors' craft, but brutality and fear alone would be nothing without the Dark Elf sense of empathy. All Elves have a natural attunement with the natural world, but while the High Elves and Wood Elves seek to gain wisdom from or live in balance with nature, the exiles of Naggaroth instead seek to dominate it. It matters not whether the beast is a raging Manticore, a viciously cunning Harpy, or a wise and ancient Dragon, given enough time a Beastmaster can impose their will upon it. Beastmasters are, in addition to their more fantastic charges, typically also responsible for the driving of slaves to battle, as the Dark Elves see humans, greenskins, and the like as mere beasts themselves. Their path is highly exacting and many eventually take on more than they can handle and are slain by one of their charges, so those that survive tend to be exceptionally cunning and martially skilled. High Beastmasters are so valued for their art and feared for their considerable skills that they hold status which nearly rivals that of the Dreadlords. Each month the Beastmaster may acquire and break in some new beasts to be used in battle, depending on the local terrain.

When Lokhir's father was slain by an assassin, the young Corsair immediately seized control of the Blessed Dread and sacrificed his rivals to the sea god Mathlann, then struck out to make his name. Tales soon reached Naggaroth of Lokhir's many deeds, the burning of High Elf port of To Canabrae greatest among them, and unimaginable treasure flowed to the coffers of Karond Kar once more. Lokhir is much admired by his crew, for he fights at the forefront of battle and never shies from a risky chance to take slaves and plunder. In battle Lokhir Fellheart can be easily recognised by the disturbing Kraken Mask he wears, plundered from an ancient sunken Lizardman city, which spreads terror amongst his foes and heals his wounds in seconds. He wields the paired Red Blades, forged from a statue of priceless Indan Bloodsteel looted from the Great Temple of Gilgadresh."

Always ambitious and reckless, even for the bastard son of a Dark Elf noble family, Malus rose to be one of the foremost Masters of his city, but was frustrated by how long his ascent to power was taking. Hearing legends of a powerful artifact hidden to the north of Naggaroth he ventured into the Chaos Wastes and, though he lost most of his expedition in the process, reached the ancient temple of Kul Hadar. His senses blinded by avarice, Malus unwittingly allowed the Daemon Tz'arkan to possess him. To save his life and soul, Malus struck a deal with the Daemon to seek out five artifacts and perform a ritual that would free Tz'arkan, but having completed this quest the Daemon was not freed but instead forever bound to his own dark soul. Malus now battles constantly with Tz'arkan for control of his actions, but benefits from the considerable power of being bound to the Daemon. In battle Malus rides atop an especially vicious and unusually intelligent Cold One named Spite and is armed with the Warpsword of Khaine, greatest of the five artifacts his Tz'arkan had him recover."

#descr "The most favoured amongst the elite few that can call themselves Sorceress Supreme are granted the gift of a Dark Pegasus by the head of the Convent, Morathi herself. Dark Pegasi are creatures native to Naggaroth, especially the northern regions bordering the Chaos Wastes, and are a dark reflection of the noble Pegasi found in Ulthuan and the Old World. Corrupted by the taint of Chaos, they are carnivorous and predatory, but blessed with the same keen mind as their cousins. They make excellent mounts and a Sorceress Supreme that is granted one is expected to do great things. Should its rider be slain, the Dark Pegasus will fight on before fleeing to its mountainous home."

#name "Black Dragon"
#descr "While the Dragons of Ulthuan are ancient creatures that now spend most of their lives in deep slumber, the Black Dragons of Naggaroth are far younger and far more active. When Malekith first set in motion his plot to usurp the Phoenix King and claim the throne of Ulthuan for himself he had his agents steal and secret away several Dragon eggs in Nagarythe, thinking they might otherwise be destroyed in the inevitable civil war that would follow. When the Witch King's plan failed and he was forced to retreat with his forces to the inhospitable land of Naggaroth it became clear that there was no time to allow the Dragons to mature naturally and no hope that the Dragons of Ulthuan would support the exiled Dark Elves. So it was that Malekith ordered his Dragons infused with Dark Magic to accelerate their growth and they were raised as staunch allies of the Druchii who see the High Elves of Ulthuan as traitors and the Dragons of that land as misguided and weak. The Black Dragons were changed by the sorcery used to mature them and while they are creatures of might to rival the Moon Dragons of Ulthuan, they are no longer able to ignite their breath, instead spraying clouds of noxious poison. Although they are predatory and merciless in their way, Black Dragons still hold the honourable and noble nature of their kind and will accept only mighty warriors as riders. Malekith regards each Black Dragon as a member of his family and they are seen as sacred by the Dark Elves, symbols of their ability to adapt, overcome, and prove their strength."

#name "Hag Sorceress of Ghrond"
#descr "Morathi's existence has been one of scheming and manipulation. Who knows how many of Aenarion's darker deeds sprang from seeds she planted in his mind, or how different the history of the Elves might have been had he not rescued her from the clutches of a Slaaneshi warband? Yet for all of her beauty, her wiles, and Aenarion's passion for her, she was ultimately spurned by the first Phoenix King and the heartbreak of that betrayal has a perfect match in the aggrievement felt by all Dark Elves. Morathi's obsession has long been to see her son, Maelkith, ascend to his rightful place as ruler of Ulthuan, and the world beyond it, but her methods often run counter to Malekith's wishes and advance the power of the Chaos God Slaanesh, with whom she shares a long history. Morathi was behind the rise of the Cult of Pleasure which preceded the Sundering of the Elven race and she still uses that Cult to her advantage and secretly benefits from the blessings of the Dark Prince. Yet the Hag Sorceress is also greatly favoured by Khaine and, much to the disgust of her rival Crone Hellebron, is considered sacred to the Khainite faith. Morathi's beauty and presence are truly legendary, befitting a creature that can call even bitter rival Gods her patrons, and it would take a will of iron to resist her charm let alone raise a weapon against her. Morathi rides into battle atop her Dark Pegasus Sulephet, a creature she has bonded to her soul such that its life is forever bound to her own. She is primarily a user of magic, one of the greatest to ever live, but carries the dread spear Heartrender should she need to take a more direct approach."

#name "Death that Walks Unseen"
#descr "Shadowblade is still relatively young, having known less than two centuries of Maelkith's rule. His reputation, however, is legendary, and his arrogance as bottomless as the sea. Fables of his grisly exploits are already used as stories to scare Dark Elf children, a litany of murder and terror that grows longer and bloodier with each passing day. The incredible deeds of this assassin are hard to corroborate however, as few have ever encountered him and lived, and it is said that even Hellebron is unsure of his true identity, as Shadowblade personally slew all of his tutors. Furthermore, those that speak of his exploits risk word reaching Shadowblade, who values his reputation but guards his secrets carefully and is quick to hunt down those that would reveal them. Unlike other Khainite Assassins, Shadowblade reports directly to Hellebron as head of the Cult of Khaine and it is rumoured she has made use of his talents to ensure her position is unchallenged. Shadowblade is an exceptional assassin, perhaps matched only be the mythic Deathmaster of the Skaven Clan Eshin, or the sorceror-assassins of the far east. In battle he makes use of the typical Khainite tools of murder, but also carries the Heart of Woe, an amulet enchanted to explode in a paralysing fireblast should he ever be slain, and has been gifted a potion by Hellebron that temporarily grants him the strength of a giant. Unlike his fellows Shadowblade has been granted special dispensation from Hellebron to employ full use of any magical items that would be of use in slaughtering his targets. As with other Khainite Assassins, Shadowblade is permanently blessed with the Mark of Khaine."

#name "Blood Queen of Har Ganeth"
#descr "Crone Hellebron is the most ancient and powerful of the Hags of the Cult of Khaine and second only to Morathi amongst the female rulers of Naggaroth. The rivalry between Morathi and Hellebron is intense, for Morathi has withheld the secrets of her eternallly youthful appearance from Hellebron, who has grown old and lost the spectacular beauty of her youth, now preferring to hide her face behind a ceremonial mask. Only through increasingly huge blood rituals can Hellebron fully regain the alluring visage she was once praised for across the continent and even then the effects of the ritual barely last for a few days. Hellebron suspects, correctly, that Morathi traffics with the Cult of Pleasure and the corruption of Slaanesh, yet if she holds definite proof she has yet to act on it. As the leader of the cult of Khaine Hellebron wields considerable priestly power but her true strength is her mastery of the arts of murder and slaughter, for she has spent many centuries faithfully learning and training in the infinite methods of violence that are the domain of her God. In battle Hellebron wields two lethal artifacts of a bygone age; the Deathsword which grants her incredible strength and the Cursed Blade which parries and slashes with a life of its own. In addition her station as Blood Queen has granted her use of the Amulet of Dark Fire, which will protect any army Hellebron accompanies from hostile magic. As with the Death Hags that serve her, Crone Hellebron cannot use magic in battle but can make powerful prayers to Khaine.

#descr "The Dwarfs are an ancient and hardy race from beneath the mountains. In the time known as the Golden Age of the Dwarfs they ruled over a vast empire, but their power has been dwindled under constant attacks from their numerous foes. Dwarfs have learned a great deal from these battles and as a result, each one of them knows a great deal about stonework and siege warfare. Their design of the crossbow is as intricate as it is genius and other races can only dream of replicating it. Dwarfs take a lot of pride in their crossbows and are often known to rigorously train their aim. Many of them have custom-made improvements to achieve even greater accuracy.

Dwarfs have learned a great deal from these battles and as a result, each one of them knows a great deal about stonework and siege warfare. The Dwarf arbalest is the most feared ranged weapon in the known world, a true masterpiece of Dwarf engineering. Although able to easily pierce even plate mail, the arbalests are time-consuming and hard to make, even by Dwarf standards.

This fact is evidenced by the length of their mighty beards and they get complete respect from other Dwarfs, who have been rightly taught to respect their elders. It is said, and the Longbeards are always quick to remind others, that ale tasted better, greenskins were larger, and Dwarfs complained less and worked harder in the past; so it is no surprise that the Longbeards are some of the most stalwart heavy infantry in the world. It is even said that a Longbeard can ignore a seemingly serious injury simply through the stubborn belief that back in their day it would barely be considered a scratch.

As Dwarf craftsmanship is valued all over the world and many Dwarfholds have lost their capacity for self-sufficiency the Dwarfs have established numerous trading posts and frequently send caravans of trade goods on potentially treacherous surface journeys. It is the protection of this vital trade that is the primary duty of the Rangers, for there are countless foes that would see Dwarf caravans as juicy targets and perhaps even kidnap traders to ransom them to the Dwarfholds. Dwarf rangers are experienced foresters used to working in harsh climates and have a deadly aim with their throwing axes and practiced skill with their two handed greataxes.

Should a Dwarf suffer some terrible personal tragedy, he will be inconsolable. The loss of his family, failure to uphold an oath or even getting forsaken in love can seriously unhinge the mind of a Dwarf. Sometimes these Dwarfs decide that the only way they can keep up the honour of their clan is to forsake any ties to his clan and become a slayer. Having forsaken everything he holds dear, the slayer seeks death by finding large monsters to fight, immune to any feelings of terror. Few manage to survive even their first encounter, but those who do are tough, violent and psychopathically dangerous. They can be easily identified by their dyed orange hair and scarred tough skin.

There are some who, having failed one too many times to find an honourable death in battle at the hands of a large creature become so desperate to meet their end by any hostile means that they shave off their slayer crests and become Doomseekers. Doomseekers care not what brings them death so long as it is in battle and as such do not specialise in seeking out powerful creatures such as trolls or giants, rather they prefer to pitch themselves into thick enemy ranks and trust the quantity of their foes to spell their doom. Still they are proud Dwarfs and hold great hatred for the enemies of their kind, so they have adapted their weapons and fighting style to best allow them to slaughter throngs of lesser foes. Doomseekers are armed with axeheads attached to lengths of chain wrapped about their arms and in battle act as a whirling storm of spinning death. While quite mad their truly extreme dedication to ending their life makes them sacred to the followers of Grimnir. Dwarf troops gladly use their own wealth to support the military efforts of their nation and require only a quarter of the usual upkeep in gold.

Ironbreakers get their name from their enchanted hammers, which they can use to destroy the shoddy pieces of scrap that other races dare to call 'armour'. Ironbreakers are often called to fight in the most remote depths of the caves and passages of the underworld against all manner of horrors and are specially trained to do battle in darkness.

Rather than using the Ironbreaker hammer and shield they use Firedrakes, an invention of the Engineers Guild that is essentially a small battering ram capable of spraying a burning alchemical concoction on the ranks of the enemy. Though the Firedrake is a magnificent piece of craftsmanship it is not terribly accurate and as such the Irondrakes wear armour protected with runes which ward against fire and even protect their beards with segmented Gromril plates. Irondrakes specialise in defeating the massed ranks of lesser foes that might bog down and overwhelm the traditional shieldwall through attrition. Should the Dwarfs ever recover enough lost Gromril from Golden Age ruins, they would be able to steadily outfit a small number of Irondrakes.

Ranger Captains are expected to exceed their troops in skill and make use of a deadly accurate crossbow rather than throwing axes, maintaining their range and safety not for any lack of courage, but because their rank demands the responsibility of bringing vital information back to Runebearers so the Dwarfholds may be made aware of rising threats or opportunities to avenge a grudge."

#descr "Prospectors are miners who shown some skill in leading squads of miners in search of new veins of minerals. The underway is ripe with danger, so most of them are not unfamiliar with having to strike their pick in monster flesh instead of stone. They can oversee the mining effort of a Dwarf province, increasing the amount of resources available for the war effort. They also sometimes lead miners in covert missions through the underway, skipping the hazards of the terrain above. Prospectors are granted enchanted helms which give them perfect vision in the dark."

This family often has a royal bloodline, linking them to the great dwarrows themselves. The king is advised by the Council of Elders and the combined wisdom and strength of these parts make for a stable government. Clan Kings are not only great warriors and leaders, but also historians, knowing their ancestors and the many wrongs dealt to them by heart. Kings are guardians of their people but also have a duty to avenge these wrongs and will enthusiastically seek to repay the grudges of the clan twicefold. Their equipment is naturally second to none, being finely wrought by the greatest craftsdwarfs of the clan and often passed down from a lost gold age of their people. Kings are martial, social, and spiritual leaders and as such are sacred to their clan."

#name "Engineer"
#descr "The Dwarfs are industrious people and highly skilled in the ways of engineering, the quality and reliability of their constructions being widely regarded as the best in the world. Most Dwarf inventions are practical and functional, like pumps to clear water from mine workings and simple engines to draw cages up vertical shafts. However centuries of constant warfare as their civilisation has been pressed from all sides by forces of destruction have led to numerous applications of engineering skill to the subject of warfare. Members of the Guild of Engineers incorporate the use of Rune Magic into some of their work but are not trained to use magic themselves, instead providing their knowledge of fortification, siege, and construction to the war effort along with maintaining their many inventions. Engineers are masters of physics and mathematics and can help nearby Dwarfs, even magic users, calibrate for ranged accuracy, as well as using minor runes to allow missile weapons to deliver an extra fiery sting. In addition they are able to oversee repairs and construction to restore Dwarfholds to some measure of their former glory.

#name "Giantslayer"
#descr "The Dwarfs are an ancient and hardy race from beneath the mountains. All of them are above all proud individuals and do not cope easily with failure or personal loss. The loss of his family, failure to uphold an oath or even getting forsaken in love can seriously unhinge the mind of a Dwarf. Sometimes these Dwarfs decide that the only way they can keep up the honour of their clan is to cut any ties to his clan and become a slayer. Having forsaken everything he holds dear, the slayer seeks death by finding large monsters to fight. Few manage to survive even their first encounter, but those who do are tough, violent and dangerous. They can be easily identified by their dyed orange hair and scarred tough skin. This Slayer has managed to slay a Troll in battle, a clear sign that he has been marked out for a great death by Grimnir. He is now tasked with ending the life of a foul Giant. Giantslayers bear the mark of Drengi and though they seek a worthy death, they have a supernatural ability to avoid mortal blows. The presence of a Giantslayer in battle will enhance the potency of the magical tattoos of other Slayers.

#name "Runesmith Apprentice"
#descr "Dwarfs are naturally highly resistant to magic and find it hard to use, despite their strong interest in education and dedication to craft. They are a highly resourceful people though, and have developed practices which allow them to use magic in a structured and practical fashion well suited to their patient minds. Rune Magic is the most pervasive form used by Dwarfs and is based on storing and shaping magic through their runic language, bypassing the drawbacks of magically Drained environment. Rune Magic is especially powerful in forging magical items but also allows for the use of ritual spells constructed over a longer period, though it is rather poorly suited to the hectic envrionment of the battlefield. The Guild of Runesmiths is greatly admired within Dwarf society and wields considerable power, so it is never short of Apprentices. Rune Magic is extremely demanding and difficult to master, requiring both natural talent and lifelong dedication, so it is not uncommon for an Apprentice to never rise above this rank. Apprentices typically contribute to the routine arming of the troops rather than pursuing works of higher craftsmanship and their focus on lesser Rune Magic means they do not lose magical power in battle, unlike some other Runesmiths.

#descr "Thunderers are Dwarf warriors trained in the use of the Thunder Staff, an weapon invented by Dwarrow Runesmiths in the Golden Age and refined by the Guild of Engineers. With these artifacts they are able to hurl bolts of lightning great distances and with considerable accuracy, delivering powerful jolts of electricity which completely bypass armour. Thunder Staffs also make formidable melee weapons, being well balanced Dwarf steel and still capable of delivering a fatal jolt. Thunder Staffs can only be forged with great difficulty, but should the Dwarfs ever recover enough of their lost Golden Age forges they would be able to steadily outfit a small number of these troops. Dwarf troops gladly use their own wealth to support the military efforts of their nation and require only a quarter of the usual upkeep in gold."

#name "Runelord with Anvil"
#descr "In the Golden Age of the Dwarfs it is said that even minor Dwarfholds could field multiple Runesmiths each with an Anvil of Doom, an enchanted anvil that allowed the use of powerful Rune Magic on the battlefield and allowed the Dwarfs to overcome their magical disadvantages. As the Dwarf empire declined many of these artifacts were lost, the art of their enchantment and usage was taken to the grave by tradition-bound Runelords, or they simply lost their power. They are now a rare sight, though no less powerful than ever. At this crucial moment as the Dwarf seeks to restore their former glory, many Runelords have rediscovered methods to reactivate a dormant Anvil of Doom and so they are once more being deployed on the battlefield. Now that the Runelord has taken position at an Anvil of Doom he no longer loses magical power in battle and by striking his hammer upon the ancient runes of the Anvil, is able to cast spells at a greatly increased rate. Further, the Anvil will constantly reinvigorate its user and entirely protect them from lightning.

Thorek's legendary dedication to his craft and to the elevation of his people was shaped by the terrible fate of his own clan and though he calls Karak Azul home, like every Ironbrow he longs to reclaim his clan's former Dwarfhold. Thorek is a traditionalist even by the standards of Dwarf Runesmiths and holds no truck with whatever runes might be fashionable this century or that, tirelessly sticking to redisovering and mastering the ancient runes, so many of which were lost after the Golden Age ended. Thorek is the keeper of Karak Azul's last active Anvil of Doom and is known to have an understanding of the mighty artifact far beyond that of other Runelords. Indeed while Thorek is extremely demanding and some would say tightfisted when it comes to teaching rune lore to other Runesmiths, it is possible that the Dwarfs would have no hope of some day reactivating the runes on dormant Anvils of Doom without his contributions to their study. Unlike some Runesmiths Thorek is not content to bitterly mourn the Dwarfs losses and instead takes the same position of Dwarfs like King Alrik Ranulfsson and High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer; that his people may retake what has been lost and end their decline. In battle Thorek makes full use of his Anvil of Doom and is the only living Dwarf capable of striking the infamous Master Rune of Doom. He personally forged and runed his hammer Klad Brakak with an entirely new rune of his own devising, based on the Ironbreaker rune, and wears armour of masterfully runed gromril metal.

As Karak Azgul fell to sudden earthwuakes and a massive greenskin horde, the Ironbrow clan chose to remain to the last and almost every member of the clan was slain, the Ironbrows shattered forevermore. Though reinforcements did finally arrive they were far too late to do anything to recover the hold and indeed could not recover more than a few of the thousands of bodies of their fallen brothers and sisters. In recognition of the bravery of those last defenders of Karak Azgul and as a promise of vengeance to their murderers, a memorial was constructed far from the fallen hold listing every one of their names. Recently the monument has begun to whisper and share knowledge that was lost long ago. It knows powerful ways to forge once lost. Now it guides the High King and the Runelords and has a plan to restore the Dwarfs to their former glory."

Their frightening battle-cry will sap strength from their foes, who will know that only death awaits those who face this chosen warrior in combat. Their quest for death has taken them across the world and they know how to traverse even the most hostile terrain. Daemonslayers bear the mark of Drengi and though they seek a worthy death, they have a supernatural ability to avoid mortal blows. The presence of a Daemonslayer in battle will enhance the magical tattoos of other Slayers. Having proven themselves to Grimnir, they have gained sacred status.

Once Josef took over the brewery quickly became renowned across the Old World, but at the height of its success disaster struck: Greenskin raiders attacked while Josef was away, burning down his home and making off with his few relatives that survived. In the smouldering ruins Bugman swore a mighty oath of vengeance and took up his ancestral axe, resolving never to set it down until he had taken his full revenge on the Greenskin filth. Over the decades many rangers have joined Bugman on his quest and they have slain countless foes, yet Bugman maintains he has barely even begun his revenge. Josef carries a powerful runeaxe and a magical tankard which constantly heals him or wounded troops. Before battle he lifts the spirits of the troops with both tales of his many victories over the Greenskins and tankards of his superb ale.

Many of the ruling heirs of Angrund have attempted to reclaim their lost home and all have failed, but when Belegar came of age he made bold oaths and set out to recover his full inheritance and restore his Clan's honour. In the many decades since that time Belegar has achieved more than any of his predecessors and won countless battles against the Skaven and Greenskins that infest the Eight Peaks yet has still not reclaimed his throne, though Clan Angrund does now have a foothold on the surface of the lost Dwarfhold. Belegar is known as a tireless and skilled warrior, exceeded only by the famous Slayer King Ungrim Ironfist in martial prowess, and is a legendarily canny strategist, particularly when it comes to siege warfare. He strides into battle bearing the ancient Shield of Defiance and the devastating Hammer of Angrund, symbols of the strength and resolve of his people."

Torn between his dual Oaths to seek death as a Slayer and protect his people as King, he settled on establishing the massive Slayer Shrine of Karak Kadrin and passing on the Slayer Oath to his offspring. Although Ungrim cannot truly seek death as a Slayer he is by far the most restless and warlike Dwarf King and constantly leads his Dwarfhold to battle. Armed with the monstrously powerful Axe of Dargo, cloaked in the skin of the Dragon Fyrskar and with the Slayer Crown upon his head, he is a nearly unmatched dealer of death on the battlefield. As a Slayer Ungrim bears the mark of Drengi and is supernaturally able to avoid mortal blows. Ungrim is greatly revered amongst the Slayers and has attained sacred status for his dedication to their ways.

#name "Master Runelord"
#fixedname "Kragg the Grim"
#descr "Kragg is the Master Runelord of the Runesmith's Guild. He is the oldest and by far the most experienced living Runesmith - a gnarled old Dwarf, strong and enduring as weather-beaten boulder. His expression is one of eternal disapproval, his beetling brow and granite-like face a withering condemnation of younger, more frivolous Dwarfs. This is quite normal for a Dwarf of his age who has seen many wonders and watched the inevitable decline of craftsmanship and respect. Runesmiths from across the Dwarf realms pay homage to him, for Kragg knows many ancient secrets and acts as a living embodiment of the legendary history of the Dwarfs. Kragg rarely emerges from the Underhalls, preferring instead to labour secretly on his craft and seek to recover the lost arts, jealously guarding any rediscovered lore. Perhaps one day he will find a worthy successor, but so far none have met his exacting standards, much to the chagrin of many talented and aspiring Runesmiths. Kragg is particularly favoured by the Ancestor Spirits and does not lose magical might in combat like most runesmiths. It is rumoured that Kragg holds the knowledge to reactivate an ancient Anvil of Doom, but for his own enigmatic reasons has chosen not to do so. Thusfar none have dared question his decision. Kragg's crowning achievement is his own personal rune, inscribed on his hammer, which transfers heat to any object it strikes, making it both more efficient when forging and also far more lethal in battle.

#name "Engineer Guildmaster"
#descr "Burlok Damminson is the current master of the Engineers Guild and regarded as one of the greatest Engineers of all time. A stern and exacting Master, he demands adherence to traditional engineering tenets from his Engineers and rejects inventions or theories which diverge from this dogmatic approach. Yet it was not always so; in his youth, already considered an Engineering genius, Burlok was quick to defy the warnings from older Engineers and created many exotic and outlandish machines, believing that field testing and trial-by-error was necessary to make progress. This all ended when, following an experiment with a new steam pressure vessel, Burlok lost his workshop and his left arm in a massive explosion. Chastened by the experience and scolded by his father from bringing disrepute to their family, Burlok took his youthful energy and clear genius and applied it to the proper Dwarf path of Engineering; gradually and painstakingly building of centuries of quality work. Burlok created a mechanical arm to replace his lost limb, truly one of the wonders of the world, and in battle wields a hammer inscribed with a rune of swiftness as well as his master-crafted arbalest.

#name "High King of Karaz-a-Karak"
#descr "Thorgrim Grudgebearer is the current High King of the Dwarfs, a position to which he was unanimously appointed by the council of Clan Kings both for his incredible deeds in avenging grudges and recovering lost artifacts and his inspiring vow to strike every grudge from the Dammaz Kron, the Great Book of Grudges. Such an oath is of course impossible, for not even in a hundred lifetimes could any High King achieve such a feat, but Thorgrim's unwavering commitment to seeking justice for his people has energised them in a way no High King has managed for generations. As the High King Thorgim is duty bound to be born into battle atop the Throne of Power, the ancient seat of Dwarf rulership, which is inscribed with lost runes of power, protection, and healing which protect both the King and his Thronebearers. Atop his brow rests the Dragon Crown of Karaz, once worn by the founder of Karaz-a-Karak, protecting him from harm is the master-wrought Armour of Skaldour, and in his hand the fabled Axe of Grimnir, the final gift of the Dwarf God of War to his people before he departed north never to be seen again. In battle Thorgrim is a bulwark of Dwarf might, ingenuity, and resolve, reading aloud from the Great Book of Grudges even as he carves a path through the enemy ranks. Such is the power of this reading that any who stand before him on the field of battle will be forever cursed.

#descr "King Kazador of Karak Azul is huge for a Dwarf, standing a head above his peers and sporting even more thick muscle. Even as a young Dwarf he was marked out as special, taking a carefree pleasure in excelling in the crafts of his people, tirelessly labouring alongside those he would one day rule and gambling, drinking, and hunting Greenskins in the mountains of his ancestors. As a King he ruled wisely and energetically, avenging many of Karak Azul's Grudges and establishing his Dwarfhold as a true power in the South, the only remaining Dwarf Kingdom to be such. Yet when leading his throng on a campaign to annihilate several Goblin strongholds Kaador received disastrous news: the infamous Orc Warlord Gorfang Rotgut had launched a lightning raid on the hold, captured most of the royal family including Kazador's wife, and humiliated his son and heir by shaving his beard and tattooing a crude Orc glyph on his head. From that day on Kazador was a changed Dwarf, dour and brooding, his previous lust for life transformed into an obsessive drive for vengeance, particularly against the Greenskins. Kazador carries three heirlooms of his hold to battle: a terrible and powerful warhammer, rune engraved gromril armour, and the legendary Thunderhorn. Such is Kazador's reputation for violent revenge and the depth of his grief that as he strides into battle blowing reverberating notes on the Thunderhorn his foes find themselves filled with fear and panic."

The Marksmen are not State Troops and lack the discipline and armour of State crossbowmen, but none can argue with their effectiveness at range. Marksmen dress in the black livery of Nuln and by tradition each displays their personal certification of marksmanship on their hip. Extensive training is required to gain this certificate and Marksmen thus few forces field marksmen in large numbers."

#descr "In addition to fielding specially trained Marksmen to support the State Troops of the Empire, the Imperial Arsenal in Nuln has a permanent standing force dedicated its protection. This force is made up of hardened veterans and expert marksmen who are regularly drilled to ensure their cohesion and effectiveness. The Nuln Ironsides, as they are known, have mastered the combined use of the two traditional weapons of the Southern states, the halberd and the crossbow. Many a foe has closed to melee seeking to escape volley after volley of deadly accurate crossbow fire only to find themselves dashed on a wall of steel. The Ironsides are given the best equipment available to the Arsenal and are heavily armoured, though being neither noble nor in the direct service of an Elector Count they have no access to the finest dwarf-forged full plate of the Knightly Orders."

They were granted the autonomous province of the Moot by Emperor Ludwig and the land has since become known as the breadbasket of the Empire. Small and plump, with a fondness for food and drink, they are not natural fighters and are reluctant to serve in the military but are excellent woodsmen and are extremely resistant to hostile magic. The Moot has no standing army but often contributes small contingents of colourfully uniformed gamekeepers, watchmen and militia to the armies of the Empire. Halflings are superb shots and can hunt for game to provide supplies for friendly troops."

Imperial Knights wear Dwarf forged full plate of incredible quality, arm themselves with broadswords and lances and ride heavy warhorses into battle. The impact of their charge is second only to the Lance formations of Bretonnia and can turn the tide of battle in a heartbeat. While many orders have a strong religious element their strict loyalty to their Grand Master and Inner Circle above all else keeps them from taking the role of sacred warriors."

They are an elite within an elite who form the personal bodyguard of the Grand Master and are a powerful force on the battlefield. The Grand Order of the Reiksguard recruit from the oldest noble families of Altdorf and are perhaps the most powerful of all Knightly Orders. They use the conventional lance, shield and broadsword, but their armour is of particularly high quality and is polished to a mirror-like finish which dazzles their enemies. While their order holds great power and their Grand Master has taken the title of Reiksmarshall, second only to the Emperor himself in matters of war, they are always careful to remain apolitical and seem to place loyalty to the Emperor before the goals of their Brotherhood."

He returned days later, near delirious, but bearing the head of his quarry. Filled with courage, the knights formed a new Order in his honour and fought their way home. Since that day the Gold Lion have proven tireless and loyal defenders of the Empire. In combat they favour curved swords of Arabian design."

#descr "Theodore Bruckner is a hulking brute of a man known to be inhumanly strong and implacable in dispensing justice at the behest of the ruler of the city of Nuln, Countess Emmanuelle Liebwitz. Theodore holds the position of Headsman and Champion of Nuln and as such as responsible for standing in for the Countess in any trial-by-combat demanded by a member of the aristocracy of that city, as per ancient laws. In this position he has crushed a great many skilled fencers, mercenary swordsmen, and arrogant knights, falling back on his incredible strength and toughness should his not inconsiderable talent with a blade be outdone. Theodore's origins are shrouded in mystery, but it is rumoured he is descended from Norse stock and perhaps his physique bears the touch of Chaos, though none would suggest as much in public. In battle Theodore rides atop the equally unusually massive Demigryph 'Reaper', a beast purchased by the Countess from the Imperial Zoo at exorbitant cost. He is armed with the traditional sword of the Champion of Nuln known as Liarsbane, a powerful Stormlance to use on the charge, and a Baleflame amulet which protects him from hostile magic and, should he fall in battle, will explode into a fireball. Though he is greatly feared and respected, Theodore Bruckner is an executioner, not a leader, of men."

A gruff and serious man with little patience for intrigue, he embodies many of the values Middenlanders feel mark their superiority to other inhabitants of the Empire.

A man of considerable physical strength, Boris wears heavy armour and carries a thick shield and the Middenland Runefang into battle. Being a loyal and favoured follower of the warrior god Ulric he has been granted a talisman which offers him protection against hostile magic and heals his wounds."

#descr "Aldebrand Ludenhof is the Elector Count of the often overlooked province of Hochland. Being one of the smallest provinces of the Empire and featuring dense forests across much of its land, Hochland has long been used to lacking the political and economic clout of its neighbours. Compounding their reduced presence on the national scale is the fact that Hochland's population is routinely beset by the Greenskins, Beastmen, and bandits that lurk beyond the villages and roadways. Aldebrand is very much the right man for the job, a shockingly tall but thin man with a keen intellect and an always serious and upright character. The Count is noted for his love of hunting, especially falconry, and his incredible knowledge of battle tatics and military strategems. While he may not be the greatest warrior amongst the Electors, the people of Hochland swear he is the greatest leader, assigning almost supernatural abilities to him. In battle Aldebrand is armed with the Runefang of Hochland and also carries a trained hunting falcon."

#descr "Bordering the dangerous and chaos influenced land known as Troll Country, Ostland has always been a rather poor province where life is hard and often cheap, though its people are as a consequence notoriously tough and willing to fight. It is home to many peoples who long ago migrated from the east to seek shelter from the forces of Chaos and is perhaps closer culturally to Kislev than any other province in the Empire. The Raukov family are descended from steppe people and known for their hunting of Chaos marauders and loyalty to the Empire, so when the preceding Elector Count was found to be a follow of Tzeentch it was natural that the foremost scion of the Raukovs took the position. Known as the Black Count for his livery and association with death, Valmir von Raukov has proven to be a notoriously warlike and ruthless military leader, winning many battles against the forces of Chaos and leading punitive raids beyond the borders of Ostland. In battle Valmir wields the Runefang of Ostland but is primarily known for his superb skill with the magical Dragon Bow, even from horseback."

Karl is perhaps the greatest statesman and diplomat the Empire has ever seen and under his rule the greatest of the human realms has recovered and surpassed its former glory. Karl was an intellectual prodigy in his youth, quickly learning any discipline he turned his hand to, be it engineering, music, philosophy, history, or law, but he always knew his true calling was to rule his people not with sheer might, politicking, or religious fervour but with justice and rationality leading the way. In addition to his many academic talents, the Emperor is also a highly skilled general and leader of men and has on numerous occasions proven his own bravery and mettle in combat. Karl Franz rides into battle mounted atop his mighty Griffon 'Deathclaw' armed with the Reikland Runefang and protected by the magic of the Silver Seal."

He is said to have never smiled in his life. His role is to uphold the Emperor's justice during trials of combat. Such trials are a judicial right of high ranking noblemen accused of breaking the Emperor's laws. Ludwig is also the Emperor's bodyguard and his mere presence has so far proven enough to discourage any attempts on the Emperor's life. On the battlefield Ludwig wields the unerring Sword of Justice and carries aloft the Emperor's personal standard. Though Ludwig is no tactician and gives no rousing speeches, the knowledge that he is watching spurs men under his command to feats of bravery. To date Ludwig Schwarzhelm has never been defeated."

#descr "Every seven years, the Masters of the eight magical colleges in Altdorf enter a contest of magical might to decide which of them will reign as the Supreme Patriarch. The most recent contest was won by the young and brilliant Patriarch of the Gold College, Balthasar Gelt. Gelt is a mysterious figure, having kept his face concealed by a gold mask for the past decade, but is undeniably a prodigy and is reckoned to be perhaps the most powerful Supreme Patriarch in history. He carries two heirlooms of the Gold College; the Amulet of Sea gold, which protects against hostile magic, and the Cloak of Molten Metal, which protects against missile fire and creates illusionary copies of the mage. As Supreme Patriarch he also wields the Staff of Volans, an ancient and powerful artifact that boosts his already superb magical abilities and allows him to generate magic gems. The rulers of Nuln recently gifted Gelt a pegasus on which he soars over the battlefield, turning the tide with his spells. Should Gelt be slain in battle his Pegasus will fight on for a time before fleeing to the wilds.

#descr "Every seven years, the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the eight magical colleges in Altdorf enter a contest of magical might to decide which of them will reign as the Supreme Patriarch for the next seven years. This is an important decision, because the Winds of Magic will blow strongly for the college which supplies the Supreme Patriarch. Thyrus Gormann, Patriarch of the Bright College, held this postition for many years, before being usurped by a young Gold Mage of extraordinary power named Balthasar Gelt. He has taken his loss well and sworn loyalty to Gelt, but his fiery nature ensures he will be first amongst the challengers in the next meeting. In preparation of their rematch Gormann has crafted a magical staff said to contain the tear of an Emperor Dragon which has amplified his pyromantic prowes and granted him the ability to project his magic over great distances and with incredible accuracy. As a fire mage, Gormann is arguably unsurpassed in the Old World.

#descr "Luthor Huss first came to the attention of the Empire when he roused a small village against a large warband of Beastmen and successfully beat them back, slaying many with his great hammer. When a relief force arrived to defend the village, the young Warrior Priest pursued the Warband alone, tracking them and single handedly taking the head of their Shaman leader. Years of bravely fighting the forces of heresy and Chaos saw Luthor rise to prominence in his order, eventually becoming the representative of the Warrior Priests in the Sigmarite Council in Altdorf. Here Luthor first confronted the Arch-Lectors and accused them of corruption and weakness; an act resulting in his dismissal. Since that day he has travelled the Empire smiting evil and inspiring the people with his great speeches, claiming that battlefield and village are his temple and rejecting the often opulent structures of the Cult of Sigmar. In battle Luthor is surrounded by an aura of spiritual power which tests the courage of any mortal foe trying to strike him, particularly the heretical followers of false gods. As the Voice of Sigmar Luthor spreads the dominion of his God."

Though their goals are rather different the University works closely with the Imperial School of Engineers and at times even the Bright, Grey and Gold Colleges. The University is closely monitored by both the Colleges of Magic and the Sigmarite Faith, for many is the bright young scholar or frustrated academic who has in the past pursued knowledge not meant for mortals and strayed into the world of dark arcana or heresy. Consequently Scholars of Altdorf are more restricted in their studies than those of the University of Nuln. Scholars are neither Wizards nor Engineers, but their knowledge of chemistry, mathematics and philosophy makes them excellent researchers. Scholars have traditionally always flourished in slothful, decadent societies."

Here the mysteries of the world are unravelled and new theories and technologies devised, some of which are taken up with gusto by the Engineers of the Imperial Arsenal. The University of Nuln has a long standing rivalry with that of Altdorf and in recent years have extricated itself further from the grip of Sigmarite dogma. This has sparked talk of possible heresy within the walls of the institution, but Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz of Nuln has rebuffed all Sigmarite probes in this matter as a threat to her authority. Scholars are neither Wizards nor Engineers, but their knowledge of chemistry, mathematics and philosophy makes them excellent researchers.

They are known to mutter to themselves constantly as they tinker with their contraptions or engage eachother in conversations nonsensical to the common soldier or high ranking noble alike. Despite their unusual and somewhat alarming behaviour Engineers are a boon to the Empire and are the minds behind weapons such as the arbalest, repeater crossbow, and hand crossbow which have been invaluable on the front lines. They are also beloved by the Elector Counts for their knowledge of the construction, defence, and taking of fortifications. On the battlefield a Master Engineer will bring to bear his customised arbalest with attached telescopic sight and explosive bolts and may improve the accuracy of nearby ranged troops by offering them the benefit of complex calculations taking into account humidity, wind, and even something they call the 'curvature' of the land.

Rather than preaching punishment for man's sins and the coming of the end of the world, they take a more direct approach befitting their pragmatic and vengeful god, Ulric. Gathering together and clothing themselves in the furs of wolves, the Kin dedicate themselves to the service of Ulric and mete out punishment to Orcs, Beastmen, and other agents of destruction and evil. They fight with a cold, controlled fury, hacking down their foes with axe and sword and rarely taking a step back. Though eager to slay their enemies, the Wolf Kin understand when to stick to the shadows and are adept at guerilla warfare. The Wolf Kin are led on missions of vengeance by Wolf Fathers, veteran kinsman invested with priestly authority by the Temple of Ulric. Ulric grants his followers superior resistance to magic."

Nearly all members of the Ulrician clergy are Warrior Priests, well equipped men of steel will and great martial prowess. They carry two handed handed axes, symbols of justice and vengeance.

Heresy, corruption and the malign influence of Chaos might take root in the hearts of the discontent, the greedy or the curious at any moment. While the Sigmarite faith does much to shield the collective soul of man there comes a time when a surgeon is required to cut out the infection. Since the Storm of Chaos the Witch Hunters have been granted considerable authority to pursue their grim mission. These men are loners of grim resolve who unnerve the common man. It is said no matter where they tread they will uncover corruption and dissent and more often than not they will personally put an end to it. Witch Hunters are trained and equipped to confront rogue magic users, the undead and even daemons."

A seasoned warrior and tactician, he is best known for slaying an Orc Warboss and driving off his wyvern, thereby scattering a horde that threatened to rampage throughout Ostland. Werner is one of the most skilled defensive swordsmen in the Empire, having spent his time before joining the Knights Panther as a noted duelist. He is armed with a lightning fast magic blade liberated from an Emir in Araby centuries ago, which greatly amplifies his talents."

The symbol of the Eighth Lore is the Arrow and the colour of the Order's garb is brown. The energies of Ghur are those of beasts and wild places most inimicable to man. Amber Wizard Lords are even more reclusive and wild than their brothers in the Order and will often go years without any human contact whatsoever. To attain the rank of Lord, an Amber Wizard must confront one of the giant bears of the Great Forest, stare down the beast and form a permament bond with its primitive mind. From that day forth they are as one, mage and beast tearing through the enemy ranks in perfect destructive harmony."

The symbol of the Second Lore is a soaring eagle and the colour of the Order's garb is yellow. The energies of Chamon are heavy and are drawn to pool around metal. Gold Wizards often bear traces of their experiments in alchemy and transmutation, chemical stains and scorch marks, but also garb of fine quality and a great deal of jewellery. Gold Wizard Lords are particularly powerful members of society, as they have mastered many methods of transmutation and inevitably amassed a small personal fortune. The usage of vitriol and acid spells is restricted within the Gold order to Lords as this powerful magic is considered too dangerous for rank and file members."

Pale skinned and gaunt, Amethyst Wizards are shunned by most folk, associated with death and decay, but the need for knowledge of this darkest Lore of magic is great. A Wizard Lord of the Amethyst College is a figure of great fear and mystery, as the energies of Shyish seem to permeate their very being. The merest touch of a Lord's scythe can cause instant death and even worse, those slain are likely to continue to serve the Lord in undeath. Despite this, these grim men are known to be fierce enemies of all manner of undead."

Celestial Wizards spend much of their time in observatories, mapping and researching these distortions, seeking to predict future events. A Celestial Wizard Lord has an almost unparalleled knowledge of the heavens and through observation and calculation can provide startlingly accurate predictions of future events. While their knowledge and advice are often sought, they are also known for their ability to direct devastating strikes from the heavens, in the form of blasts of lightning or even hurtling chunks of celestial firmament itself."

The wind of Hysh is the purest amongst the Lores, though it is also the most effusive and difficult to master. Because of this, comparatively few Light Wizards ever earn the title of Wizard Lord. Those that do are true masters of the arcane who have begun to understand the nature of magic itself and can bend Light energy itself to reproduce facets of the other Lores. This focus on demanding study leaves the Lords physically weak, but at the head of a Communion of Light, they are powerful indeed."

Honouring an Order with a memorial to their fallen is an expensive act, but it will result in a group of Inner Circle Knights and perhaps even the Grandmaster of the Order pledging to serve your cause. The Order of the Sacred Scythe are one of the most feared forces in the Empire, for such is their hatred of the undead that they have been known to put entire villages to the torch should they be found guilty in tribunal. Many members of the Order are sworn to the service of Morr, God of the Dead, and each of them is well versed in the hunting of vampires. Encased in black steel and armed with sacred silver scythes they patrol the fell roads of Stirland, ever watchful for incursions from neighbouring Sylvania. The Scythes are ever watchful and though despised by the common folk, maintain a network of spies to better root out hidden foes.

Typically operating in small groups to track Beastmen Warbands, the Hunters are expert woodsmen and can always rely on the support of the populace who appreciate such mighty warriors stooping to defend even the smallest villages. The nature of their mission means Hunters' equipment is often worn from travel and lacking the services of blacksmiths, they often discard pieces of armour damaged in skirmishes.

#descr "The grim Shadow Warriors hail from a terrible time, when the land of Nagarythe was riven with civil war. Most of the populace sided with the Witch King and became Dark Elves. Those who did not became the Shadow Warriors. They fought from hiding against the Dark Elves in a blood soaked land. They eventually became masters of guerilla warfare, striking with deadly accuracy from the shadows. Today they are the most sinister and brutal of all the High Elves, and bound to their bitter duty with ancient oaths. Their hatred knows no bounds when it comes to the Dark Elves, but their wrath for any foe is terrible. They go before the armies of Ulthuan wherever they go, killing and clearing way for the main force. They have learned to predict enemy missile fire and avoid it."

#descr "Rangers are High Elf warriors who hail from the more remote parts of Ulthuan and maintain a martial tradition distinct to the citizen militia of the more populous areas. Instead, they hone their personal fighting skills in smaller training bands, coming together in times of need to fight alongside their metropolitan counterparts. Thus the skillset and garb of the High Elf Ranger differs from most, often donning lighter armour to enable swifter movement across terrain and to facilitate the greater freedom of movement required to wield two swords at once. Often coming from more insular communities that have suffered at the hands of raiders, High Elf Rangers can be bitter, haughty, and proud, but have a well-deserved reputation as some of the most steadfast warriors of the Asur, particularly when it comes to defence of their lands against their hated cousins the Dark Elves."

These finely wrought and magically enchanted ballistae are capable of unleashing multiple large bolts in a single shot with shocking precision. The Eagle Claws mounted on their ships are far too large for the Lothern Sea Guard to deploy in land battles, but they have developed a miniaturised version which they mount on a chariot similar in design to those used in Tiranoc. The crew are lightly armed and armoured and should not be expected to perform in melee, but the additional ranged power the Eagle Claw brings to bear is highly valued by High Elf commanders."

#descr "There are regions of Avelorn that the citizen soldiers are forbidden to enter. Some are sacred places of power, linked with the rites of renewal the Everqueen performs to sustain Uthuan and her people. Others are drk and dangerous places from which the touch of Chaos never fully faded. It is the duty of the Sisters of Avelorn to watch over such places, to protect them, or to protect others from them. The Sisters are an entirely female force of highly skilled archers, selected from the ranks of the citizen soldiery by the Handmaidens of the Everqueen for their skill and strength of character alike. The Sisters are taught to pursue perfection in everything they do and, both elevated beyond the petty intrigues of Ulthuan social standing and given the Everqueen as an unblemished idol, they do exactly that, be it martial, aristic, or spiritual. The Sisters of Avelorn prefer to fight their battles at long range, as they are granted spectral bows which fire mystical bolts of white-blue flame that sears tainted flesh and bone alike. Yet they are nearly as skilled in close combat, where they put a paired blade and dagger to lethal use. The Sisters are sacred to the people of Ulthuan."

Their knowledge is vast and their breadth of knowledge unsurpassed. In times of strife, the mages of Hoeth join the armies, sometimes commanding entire armies themselves.

The knowledge of making these Great Weapons was lost along with the Hammer of Vaul, but the sites is still used by the Smith Priests of Vaul to make magic items of no small power. The god Vaul was chained and blinded in a eon long war with Khaine, and his priests blind themselves to prove their devotion. The Smith Priests are dedicated to their craft and their training is devoted to crafting alone. Despite their blindness, they can make items far beyond their magic skill in other areas, but their preference for elaborate forging means they are not particularly efficient."

A select few accomplish several and even fewer master all arts. Those who do are called Loremasters. Even the martial disciplines seem easy to them and their magical knowledge is broad. Their brilliant intellects make them sublime strategists and warriors, able to thread together many nuances and ideas to insights beyond most mortals. Invariably, in times of strife, they seek battle, to better understand, and they excel at this intuitive use of magic. Meanwhile performing rituals, conducting magical research, and forging, while easy to them, is seen as uninteresting work beneath their genius. While Loremasters have considerable knowledge of the magic of death and the wilds, they regard these disciplines as somewhat unsavory or crude arcana best left to the pages of their scholarly works, rather than seeking to apply them in war. Loremasters are supremely confident and their own abilities and, truthfully, regard other mages as inferior; as such they refuse to enter communions."

Though blessed with innate magical talent these Elves are not sent to study at the White Tower of Hoeth but instead inducted into a secretive Caledorian order dedicated to protecting and rousing the slumbering Dragons of their homeland. It is said the dreams of the Dragon Mages are always of riding into battle in a great storm of Dragons the colour of the setting sun, a site not seen for thousands of years, and of burning all the foes of Caledor to ashes. Rather than making use of the full array of magic available to their kind, or even tapping into the High Magic that comes naturally to the Asur, the Dragon Mages instead use magic of dragonfire, burning sulphur, and volcanic fury. As minor nobles of Caledor they are expected to be competent military leaders and diligently train in swordsmanship and the use of their magic in close quarters."

#name "Noble of Ellyria"
#descr "The Ellyrian Reavers were formed ages ago, during a bitter war, valiantly riding deep into enemy territory to defend Ulthuan. They are brave horsemen, able to live of the land and away from supply routes. They strike fast and hard, vanishing into the wilderness. They form an important part of High Elf armies, being able to patrol ahead of the main force, intercepting enemy scouts an hunting down lone enemies or warmachines. The more experienced Reavers are called Harbingers. Nobles of Ellyria often eschew the more typical path of battle as heavy cavalry in the manner of the Silver Helms and instead go to war as the Reavers do, striking quickly and secretly with bow or blade."

#name "Shadow Walker"
#descr "The grim Shadow Warriors hail from a terrible time, when the land of Nagarythe was riven with civil war. Most of the populace sided with the Witch King and became Dark Elves. Those who did not became the Shadow Warriors. They fought from hiding against the Dark Elves in a blood soaked land. They eventually became masters of guerilla warfare, striking with deadly accuracy from the shadows. Today they are the most sinister and brutal of all the High Elves, and bound to their bitter duty with ancient oaths. Their hatred knows no bounds when it comes to the Dark Elves, but their wrath for any foe is terrible. They go before the armies of Ulthuan wherever they go, killing and clearing way for the main force. Shadow Walkers are the leaders of cadres of Shadow Warriors and are appointed by the group based on their talent for slaying Dark Elves, not their authority or nobility, an unusual arrangement in the Ulthuan military. As such they make capable commanders, but only of smaller forces. Such is their talent in warring with the hated foe that they have learned to predict enemy missile fire and avoid it with barely a thought."

#descr "Highest ranking of all the Sisters of Avelorn are the Handmaidens of the Everqueen. Not the mere courtiers that their name might suggest, but warriors sworn to live and die in the service of their mistress. They are considered paragons of Elvenkind, as talented in artistic and spiritual pursuits as they are on the field of battle. The honour of serving as a Handmaiden is only bestowed on those Sisters who have many times over proven their worth in battle and earned the respect and admiration of their fellows. Handmaidens act as direct representatives of the Everqueen and as such have been imbued with priestly authority in the order of Isha, Goddess of Harvest and life. They are armed with the same deadly bows as the Sisters they often command, but have also mastered the use of the Spear of Avelorn, a polearm blessed with the same righteous blue fire of the Everqueen. Such is their skill with the spectral Bow of Avelorn that they can loose two arrows in the space of a breath."

They are traditionally recruited from the rugged land of Chrace, a perilous realm whose inhabitants are great woodsmen and fierce warriors. Those woodsmen who are proven worthy, form an elite bodyguard, armed with terrible long handled Chracian Axes. The White Lions are often despatched to join armies, protecting generals and mages, or bolstering the strength of the army. They are renowned for their unflinching courage in the face of overwhelming odds and horrors. Guardians are the veteran leaders of bands of White Lions who protect important figures, places, and meetings. They are not Nobles and lack their leadership or authority, but are well able to navigate forces through forests and mountainous terrain. More importantly, they are highly skilled if slightly unrefined personal combatants."

#name "Dragon Mage on Sun Dragon"
#descr "Into every generation of Caledorian nobility a handful of Dragon Mages are born. Though blessed with innate magical talent these Elves are not sent to study at the White Tower of Hoeth but instead inducted into a secretive Caledorian order dedicated to protecting and rousing the slumbering Dragons of their homeland. It is said the dreams of the Dragon Mages are always of riding into battle in a great storm of Dragons the colour of the setting sun, a site not seen for thousands of years, and of burning all the foes of Caledor to ashes. Rather than making use of the full array of magic available to their kind, or even tapping into the High Magic that comes naturally to the Asur, the Dragon Mages instead use magic of dragonfire, burning sulphur, and volcanic fury. As minor nobles of Caledor they are expected to be competent military leaders and diligently train in swordsmanship and the use of their magic in close quarters. This Dragon Mage has awoken a Sun Dragon and formed a sacred bond with this ancient ally, riding into battle as a deadly union of Elf and Dragon. Should the Mage be struck down the Sun Dragon will fight on for the remainder of the battle before returning to its slumber."

#descr "Dragons are amongst the oldest and most powerful of all creatures, having dwelt in the world long before the arrival of Chaos and crossed the skies when none of the mortal races of Men, Elves, or Dwarfs yet existed. Though they are now rare indeed they live large in the tales of every culture, typically as cruel and destructive forces, bringers of death and destruction. The island continent of Ulthuan is home to the largest remaining population of Dragons, with many hundreds slumbering in the mountains of Caledor, and to the Elves they are not destructive beasts to be feared, but cherished allies of celebrated intelligence and honour. It is known that in times past the Dragons have on several occasions saved Elvenkind, but few know that in doing so they prevented the entire world from falling to Chaos. In recent centuries the Dragons have taken to sleeping for longer and longer, especially the oldest and mightiest of their number, and it is increasingly difficult to raise them, though the Dragon Mages of Caledor have turned the task of rousing them through song into a fine art. Every Dragon is a force on the battlefield, physically mighty, surprisingly fast for its size, and capable of breathing a searing torrent of fire on its foes. Sun Dragons are the youngest and least powerful of the Dragons of Ulthuan, though also the least difficult to rouse from their slumber to defend the land. They are recognisable by their bright red and orange scales and are the favoured mounts of Dragon Mages of Caledor. All Dragons are sacred to the Elves of Ulthuan."

#name "Prince of Caledor on Moon Dragon"
#descr "In times past the nobility of Caledor could form great formations of Dragon Riders, Princes of Caledor mounted atop Moon and Sun and sometimes even ancient Star Dragons, searing the foe with fire before plunging into melee. Now almost all of the remaining Dragons are prone to slumber, especially the older and more powerful Moons and Stars, and the Princes of Caledor instead ride into battle on horses with barding and armour designed in the image of their former mounts. It is unheard of for a Sun Dragon, freshly awoken, to accept a Prince of Caledor as a rider, but should a Moon Dragon be roused by the Dragon Mages it may honour the ancient alliance and select a worthy Prince to mount it and fly forth in defence of the realm. Moon Dragons are particularly known for their fierce loyalty and ability to judge the character of a Prince and together Dragon and Elf make a formidable pair. Should the Prince be slain, the Moon Dragon will fight to avenge him before returning to the mountains to grieve his loss and return to its slumber. All Dragons are sacred to the Elves of Ulthuan and Moon Dragons are such symbols of Ulthuan's ancient might that they spread the Dominion of their home."

The histories tell that the two races have fought in one another's cause since the time of the Daemon invasion, but legend carries the alliance deeper into the past. In some tales it was Talyn, King of the Eagles, who bore Ereth Khial, Goddess of the Underworld, to her ashen home at Asuryan's command. Like the High Elves, Great Eagles are haughty creatures of considerable intelligence and pride. When High Elf armies assemble, the noble Eagles too join the battle. They swoop down upon vulnerable enemy targets, tearing them apart with their powerful talons and beaks before gliding swiftly away."

Unicorns resemble horned horses superficially but this belies their magical nature and not inconsiderable strength and intellect. They are incredibly swift and able to deal terrible damage with their magical horns when charging into the fray. The Unicorns of Ulthuan are somewhat more civilised and less vindictive than their cousins in the dark woods of Athel Loren and have lost the aura of unease and fear those creatures project, but are still able to heal themselves with their innate magic."

#name "Warden of Tor Yvresse"
#descr "Eltharion the Grim was once a charming and carefree young noble, but he saw his lands ravaged and his father slain at the hands of Grom the Paunch and his incredibly destructive Waaagh. Though Eltharion led a coalition force to victory and cleansed Ulthuan of the taint of the Greenskin invasion, even decades later the devastation was still keenly felt and Eltharion himself was never quite the same, becoming stern and harrowed, his joy replaced with cold hatred of his foes and an obsessive desire to protect his people. Eltharion is lauded as one of the finest Princes of Ulthuan as a warrior, a general, and a ruler beloved by those he strives to protect, but none of this matters to the vengeful Warden, only that any threat to Ulthuan is crushed before it can do real harm; thus Eltharion is the most active of all Ulthuan's leaders in taking military action beyond her borders. Eltharion rides into battle atop his supremely loyal Griffon named Stormwing and is armed with the deadly Fangsword, protected by the heirloom Helm of Yvresse, and can draw upon the power of the fabled Talisman of Hoeth which grants him considerable magical power. Should Eltharion be slain in battle Stormwing will fight on for a time before returning to his mountain home."

#name "Griffon of Ulthuan"
#descr "The Griffons of the Annulii Mountains in Ulthuan are of a more noble temperament and higher intelligence than the cunning but savage Griffons of other lands and as such are willing allies to the High Elves, rather than merely beasts used for warfare. Though they are not cruel or bloodthirsty they are still apex predators and a terrifying force on the battlefield capable of rending men asunder and hurling fully armoured horses through the air. They are not so swift in flight as the Great Eagles but are larger and stronger, so not limited to hit and run strikes. Stormwing is the personal mount of Eltharion the Grim and is a particularly impressive example of his kind."

#fixedname "Alith Anar"
#descr "Alith Anar, Prince of Nagarythe, known to many as the Shadow King is the current ruler of the Kingdom of Nagarythe and the last member of the noble line of House Anar. Tradition maintains that the remaining loyalists of Nagarythe chose House Anar to lead them in the terrible times following the retreat of the Witch King Malekith into the west. Alith Anar is perhaps the most vengeful and feared of his line, having spent much of his life rooting out traitors and spies across Ulthuan and personally ending their lives, as well as leading punitive raids across the sea into the lands of Naggaroth itself. High Elves are typically not known to forgive easily but have a strong sense of honour which prevents them fulling embracing a war of terror and retribution: not so the Shadow King who knew the power of putting fear into the hearts of his foes with tales of his merciless vengeance. Alith Anar carries the Stone of Midnight, an item stolen from Morathi herself which shrouds him in shadows and renders him difficult to strike with mundane weapons. He is armed with the deadly Moonbow, said to have been crafted by the Goddess Lileath herself, which strikes fear into those who suffer its streaking arrows, and atop his brow sits the symbol of absolute authority over Nagarythe, the Shadow Crown, which makes the world seem slow and predictable to its wearer."

#name "Citizen Hoplite"
#descr "The citizens of Abdera decided long ago that they were too few in number to make up a major part of the regular army of the city. Their wealth made it possible to hire vast amounts of mercenaries to fight in their stead. Because of this, most citizens only fight when there is a dire need for the defense of Abdera itself. When they do fight, they take to the field as a militia phalanx copied from Arcoscephale's Cardaces. They wear everyday clothing and bronze caps, relying on their round bronze hoplon-style shield to protect themselves. Still, they are militia, and should not be expected to hold crucial portions of the battle line for any significant amount of time. They are brave, but it is a bravery born of desperation."

#descr "Abdera has inherited Berytos' tradition of fine light cavalry from the lower nobility, and these men are the embodiment of that tradition. They are good horsemen with equipment suited for quick travel, while being well enough trained to put most other light and medium cavalry to shame. Citizen lancers are armed with a heavier lance than their predecessors, which makes their charge deadly in the extreme. They are disciplined and well able to rout most of their tribal enemies with their charge, but for all this, they cannot stand up against heavier cavalry or good infantry for very long, due to their lack of a shield and their light linen armor."

#name "Molech"
#descr "The Molech is a huge brass statue that was draped in red satin clothes to signify it's status as patron deity of a city and has been given false life through worship and sacrifices. A hatch allows sacrifices to be placed inside, where they will be burnt to a crisp by the roaring furnace that burns in its belly. The screams of the sacrifices are channeled to create infernal bellowing as smoke pours from its mouth and nose. The Molech is a bringer of plenty and will reward sacrifices with rain and bountiful harvests. It has innate control over Water and mages who fight alongside it will feel their control over it increase as well. While the Molech is unable to speak, it is still a high servant of the awakening God and will rightfully spread its Dominion just like a Prophet."

This Malik has escaped the infernal prison and now seeks to don a godly mantle to free his kin. The Malik is a descendant of Azazel and shares his gifts and appetites. With the Pantokrator gone, he is free to claim the world as his banquet. From his ghastly court the Ditanim answer his call and will come to his aid whenever he goes into battle."

But even as Berytos fell, no Melqart answered their prayers, and new idols have replaced the Melqarts of ancient times. The Miqim Elim, God awakeners, are the high priests of Abdera's temples. In times of draught, they administer the human sacrifices and if the city itself is under threat, it falls to them to awaken the statues of Abdera's patron deities. Miqim Elim are capable sorcerers and their skill in imbueing false life can be useful when bringing back their God from the dead."

Where they would stay in the deepest and darkest regions of the Troldsvarheim forest to avoid the sun's harsh light, Zulkhaz would squint up into the skies in almost morbid fascination. As soon as he was old enough, he sought out a renegade Abysian warlock and convinced him to take him on as a bodyguard. The Abysian quickly realized how brilliant the young troll was and made him into his apprentice. The years of apprenticeship have left Zulkhaz's tough hide with countless burns, but in the end he learned what he had come for: How to create fire - and how to snuff it out. When he had learned all he could from his Abysian master, Zulkhaz killed him and returned to Troldsvarheim. There, he combined his knowledge of fire with the magic of death and has mastered banefire, the corrupt fires of the underworld. Now the coming God of Darkness has awoken, and Zulkhaz stands ready to extinguish the flames of heaven itself in their name."

#name "Outcast"
#fixedname "Venjo"
#descr "Venjo is a mountain troll in exile, living far from his original home in the frigid mountain peaks of Ulm. Once a home for all kinds of trolls, that quickly changed as the warrior-smiths grew in both power and prominence. Resolved that the mountains and forests were no longer big enough for both man and troll, a great cleansing was called, purging the land of trolls with fire and steel. Of the trolls who survived, among them was Venjo who found a new home in the dense forests of Troldsvarheim. Venjo has great command of magic with an innate affinity for Earth, and has practiced Death magic with Troldsvar Sorcerers. Over time he has even learned the Shadow Weaving techniques employed by the Sorcerers and is now a respected one of their number. Now with the rise of the new god, Venjo is determined to stride out into the world and reconquer his far-away home."

#descr "Vranex was once a warrior chieftan in another land, until one night he and his warriors were attacked in the night by a pack of werewolves. The sound of screams and the tearing of flesh filled the night as his warriors fell before the might of the beasts. When the battle ended, Vranex stood as the last of his tribe. Unable to return to his people - doubly cursed by his defeat and the blood of the beast that now runs in his veins - Vranex has wandered the wilderness for many years, searching for meaning in his new form, only finding peace in the dark forests of Troldsvarheim with his curse giving him the strength to fight for his new home. Vranex has picked up many skills in his long life as a wanderer, and when he enters a battle wolves will come to his aid from all directions."

#descr "Nobody knows how long Zelaria has wandered the ancient forests of the world, but records of her date back countless decades, if not centuries. A tall wispy woman with silver hair glimpsed only for a heartbeat in the first light of the morning, a powerful sorceress accompanied by a pack of nightmarishly large hounds. Few have accosted her over the years and even fewer have lived to tell the tale. Zelaria has no patience for the races of man, their petty pursuits and their crude manners. Long cast out from the courts of her homeland, she is a being of fay descent never quite at home in the realm of mortals. Her ceaseless wandering has taken her into the forests of Troldsvarheim, a place free of disturbances, and she has decided to make her home there, if only for a little while."

#name "Arcane Elemental"
#descr "Arcane Elementals are projections of raw astral power given life through strong magic. Some mages have been known to seemingly take the form of an Arcane Elementals in their last moments on the Sacrificial Amplifier, but some doubt remains whether they truly ascend to this higher state of being, or if their death perhaps open a door to a plain of existence from which the Arcane Elementals come forth, drawn by the abundance of magic. Arcane Elementals are very sensitive to the fluctuations of magic and are more powerful where the presence of magic is potent. They are mindless creatures incapable of thought."

In this impossible structure of metal and stone and shinning gems live the brilliant artificers now known as the Master Makers, mage-smiths of great wisdom and knowledge.
Little is known of these enigmatic figures, expect perhaps the genius that allows them to create inscrutable and marvelous metallic beings capable of doing the strangest of things, and their kindness towards the impoverished and struggling natives of the valley who are spared being pressed into any kind of service, or even paying exorbitant taxes necessary to maintain armies akin to those in other lands, while yet enjoying the protection of the Master Makers and their automata none the same.
Spring-driven automatons powered by precious gemstones imbued with powerful elemental magic guard the citadel of the Master Makers, and all those who now call this new realm their home.
Towering metallic giants, tall as towers, stand vigil at the gates of the growing city, while automatons as tiny as a street cat, and just as agile, scurry along the busy streets, thisaway and thataway. High up on the parapets the ever-crackling and buzzing sound of lightning can be heard from tall machines that steadily hum with power, and the entire city reverberates with the ever-present sound of hammers and metallic gears tick tick ticking away."
#summary "Race: Automaton constructs. Production bonus 50% in all forts. Income penalty 25%. Mercenary penalty 25%. Capital starts with 15k population.
Military: Heavily armored automatons, colossal automatons, specialized automaton commanders.
Magic: Astral, Earth, Air, Water and Fire. Superior magic item forging. Research-bots not affected by Drain scales. Capital only mages.
Priests: Very weak"
#brief "Antikythera is the land of clockworks and spring driven automatons, ruled by mysterious and powerful Master Makers."

#name "Aurum"
#epithet "The Golden Republic"
#era 2
#descr "On the surface, the Republic of Aurum is known far and wide as a glorious golden republic where opulence and wealth permeate and seep into every aspect of society. Tales are told of high golden walls that adorn the palaces of the Republic, of patricians who compete in exhibitions of wealth and luxury, and of the numerous legions of Aurum that are seemingly clad in majestic and gleaming pure golden armor. Stories are told of golden goddesses clad in magical golden armaments that march alongside the legions of Aurum. Though the Republic might have once been nearly as incredible as the stories told, the truth now is far from reality, and nothing more than a well-maintained myth by the Senate which desperately tries to cling to power in the ever-declining Republic. The Republic's recent and numerous expansionist campaigns were motivated by massive debts and deficits in the now all but empty treasury. The Golden Legions of Aurum are little more than thinly gold-platted, or possibly even gold-painted armor, and the magical golden gear of Aurum nothing more than an expensive fabrication.
The Republic of Aurum is capable of establishing Senates and extending the reach of the Republic's great bureaucratic apparatus. The Senates possesses vast legislative powers and can even levy additional taxes, raise troops, or recklessly spend the hard-earned coin of the citizens.
Yearly elections are held in the capital of Aurum where two Consuls are chosen from the ranks of many Senators to safe-guard the Republic from foreign invaders, and usher the nation into a new golden era."
#summary "Race: Human. Can construct 7 Wonders of the World through various High Magistrates.
Military: Human legionaries and faux-golden sacred warriors.
Magic: Fire, Water, Earth, Astral, Nature, Death.
Priests: Moderate, can heal afflictions."
#brief "Aurum is a golden republic where faux-golden legions continuously march into new conquests under the command of the Consuls and of the Senate in order to preserve the well-accustomed, lavish way of life in the Republic."

#epithet "Land of Dusk and Despair"
#era 2
#descr "Azarien, the land of eternal dusk and despair is the home of the Dark Elves, a race as sinister as it is ancient. At some point in history this once noble race parted ways with sanity and wisdom and descended into utter madness and unrelenting hatred. It is unclear whether they fell under some corrupting influence of the world, or if they married themselves to it willingly. Ruled by competing urges for indoctrination and genocide, the Dark Elves foster contempt for all other races, and those subjugated suffer every possible form of injustice, oppression and cruelty. However, their homicidal tendencies and malice are not limited just to other races either, as Dark Elves routinely murder their rivals, cousins and even parents. Such behavior is not only accepted but sanctioned, believed to cull the weak and keep Azarien under powerful and ready leadership. As is only expected, Dark Elves lurk in the darkness, ever keeping to their shadows. Rarely will they come into the light for needless purposes, and some even believe that light can harm or weaken them. They are known for their deceitful nature and wicked ways, but maybe most importantly for the unnatural and twisted experiments they perform on other races, and even their own kind. Many horrors are known to lurk in the dark forests they call their home."

#name "Edranor"
#epithet "Pillars of Power"
#era 2
#descr "The harsh and sandy deserts of Edranor are home to a small group of magically-gifted people. The primary source of power of this race of mages comes not from any of the elements, or the forces of Life and Death, but rather from their emotions. Having survived a long history of slavery, strife and death, the powers that they had discovered - and that permitted them to survive and break the shackled that bound them - were those based on agony, torment, and unbridled rage born of loss and desperation. Tempered by a century of constant strife, first imposed upon them and then later self-inflicted, the people of Edranor have learned to harness their emotions to unlock their magical potential. From a very young age their children are taught to draw upon the emotions of pain and anger to fuel their magical abilities by being subjugated to excruciating and unthinkably cruel rituals. Many - of those who survive childhood - wear permanent scars which remind them of the true price of power, and those who die in the process serve as a grim reminder of what happens to those who do not posses sufficient power to protect themselves.
Human sacrifice is common in Edranor, especially in times of dire need, though it differs in form to that practiced in most other lands. It is not the weak and the helpless who are preyed upon and then used in rituals against their will, for indeed there are no weak and helpless in Edranor. Instead, mages willingly impale themselves on devices which act both as torture devices and as amplifying conduits, and then use their own endless torment to power rituals they would otherwise be incapable of performing. Such a thing could never be accomplished with an unwilling sacrifice, for an iron will and a strong motivation are paramount for such a ritual.
The people of Edranor worship only power, and neither temples nor priests hold any sway over their lands."
#summary "Race: Spell-casting humans. Commander can attain ascension by creating all five pillars in the same land and entering the Mana Vortex.
Military: A nation of mages who use spells instead of conventional weapons. Units can be trained and promoted in the national Mana Vortex site.
Magic: Fire, Astral, Blood. Can boost research, temporarily increase Magic scales, and place additional Mana Vortex sites.
Priests: None. Preaching and temples have no effect. Dominion is only spread through Pillar of Influence. Can recruit sacreds without temples."
#brief "A desert nation of spellcasters whose power comes from pain and suffering. They do not use conventional weapons but spells rather. The mages of Edranor are very powerful and deadly, through few in number and easily killed."

#descr "Bretonnia, like the Empire, was once a land where primitive human tribes fought over resources and lived in fear of Greenskins and monsters. This changed when the Bretonni tribe were blessed by the attentions of the mysterious Lady of the Lake who granted guiding visions the power of a holy Grail to a noble by the name of Gilles. Gilles gathered a group of knights known as the Grail Companions at his side and together they united the humans east of the Grey Mountains and forged a nation, defeating countless enemies of man. With the help of emissaries of the Lady the nation of Bretonnia established a strict social hierarchy of peasants sworn to obey a warrior class of peerless knights who in turn swore fealty to Lords, who served Dukes, who served the King. Bretonnia is a superstitious land with largely illiterate commonfolk and is somewhat mistrustful of outsiders, but produces excellent mounted warriors and can rely on both a devout population and the assistance of magically powerful Grail Damsels who serve the Lady."

Yet the Dark Elves know that they cannot claim their glorious inheritance while the hated betrayers the High Elves endure.

#brief "The Dwarf empire is composed of hardy Dwarfs clad in superior equipment, but they are expensive both in gold and resources. They rely on various types of infantry and have no cavalry or special monsters, just Dwarf steel and skill. They are slow on the battlefield but good marchers and have some special units can travel underground for mobility. Their magic is not well suited to the battlefield but they are nearly unparalleled smiths and builders."
#descr "The Dwarfs are an ancient race, said to have been sculpted from solid stone by Pantokrator in the early days. This seems plausible, for the spirit and body of a Dwarf are hardy like stone. Centuries ago the Dwarfs enjoyed an era of peace and prosperity known as the Golden Age, with an empire of Dwarfholds connected by countless underground passages and featuring powerful militaries and rune-endowed halls full of laughter and song. However the Dwarfs found they had many enemies and very few true friends, as the arrogant Elves attacked them and hordes of Greenskins and foul Skaven swarmed against their defences. In time the great race of the Dwarfs, strong as they may have been, were reduced to a shadow of their former glory, eroded much as a mighty mountain is by mere rain and wind. But as the other races squabble amongst themselves and forget the wisdom of their fathers, Dwarfs hone their skills and work together to build a second empire. As the the time of the ascension wars draws closer, the power of Dwarf determination grows stronger. Dwarfs are few in number, but each one of them is equipped with Dwarf steel and draws power from the spirits of his wronged ancestors."
#summary "Race: Hardy Dwarfs with excellent morale and magic resistance. Prefers Cold scale +1.
Military: Superb heavy infantry and crossbows. No cavalry. High resource costs.
Magic: Strong Earth, fire, astral, minor access to water and air. Rune Magic is weaker in battle. Drain immune.
Priests: Powerful, sometimes protected by Ancestor Spirits.
Mechanics: Forts cost 150%. Discover and defend special sites in mountains and caves to upgrade the capital significantly."

#descr "The origins of the High Elves are rooted in the nativity of the World. They were once the greatest and most powerful race in the whole world and their actions shaped history. Now their people are in decline, but still they fight on resolutely. For their diminishing race to survive, the High Elves must possess an army of unequalled skill. To this end all High Elves are taught from an early age to master the sword, spear and bow. Citizen soldiers form the core of their armies, while those completely devoted to the martial arts rank among the most fearful warriors in the old world. The High Elves were the first race to study magic and remain the greatest masters in the known world. Their magic is a siphon to chaos, and their skills in controlling, shaping and, when needed, draining magic are unsurpassed."
#summary "Race: High Elves, long lived, graceful and magically skilled.
Military: Very skilled infantry, archers and cavalry, strong elite troops, all very expensive.
Magic: Very strong Astral and Fire, strong Air and Nature, some Water and Earth. Researchers better in Magic scales. Versatile forging.
Priests: Average.
Mechanics: Mercenaries cost 25% more."
#brief "An ancient race, the High Elves protect the world from the malign influence of Chaos. Their martial skills are rivalled only by their mastery of magic. Their excellence is a necessity, for the elves are few and the powers needed to sustain their wards are great."

On their trade ventures, they founded colonies in the distant lands of the setting sun, and Abdera was but one of many at that time. But as Berytos was destroyed by the armies of Arcoscephale, contact with one after another was lost, until the young city had to fend for itself, forgotten by the rest of the world and doomed to never be found by its Melqart. Through alliances and trading with the tribes of half-men that dwell around the city and the founding of its own colonies, Abdera has managed to survive and even prosper in isolation. Now Abdera is a realm of seafaring people, relying on allies and mercenaries to fight its wars."

#descr "Hagia is a successor state of the once-great Empire of Ermor. When Death was let loose in the civil war heralding its fall, whole provinces turned to ashen wastes. The liturgical city of Hagia was one such place, previously a center of the Cult of the Shroud and the burial place of emperors now turned into a lifeless desert. In the centuries since, new people have moved into the recovering lands, marveling at the perfectly preserved cities and attempting to revive the culture of their long-gone forebears. Now, however, an ancient and hungry God is awakening in the ruins of the old Empire and Death yet again stalks the lands. Yet not all is lost. Under Hagia's great Alabaster Mausoleum lies the Lapis Manalis, a gateway to the abode of the dead. Ancient Spirits emerge at the command of the awakening God to aid the inheritors of the Empire and prevent a repeat of old follies.
Hagia organizes armies in a similar manner to the old legionary system, though they remain a pale shadow of Ermor's armies. Hagian legionaries prefer kite shields over tower shields and javelins have mostly fallen out of fashion."

#descr "Troldsvarheim is a gloomy forest seemingly always covered by bleak and ominous clouds. In the dark forests of Troldsvarheim live a peculiar breed of troll known as the Troldsvar, a dark skinned troll with an affinity for dark magic. They are seldom seen outside of their forests, for when out of darkness they are considerably weaker than other trolls.
Troldsvar sorcerers practice a unique kind of magic known as Shadow Weaving, commanding darkness itself to do their bidding, and stealing the shadows of others as their own. Some sorcerers grow weary of being at the sun's mercy and seek ways to hide it from the world.
Deep in Troldsvarheim lies the Forest of Shadows, where the most powerful of the trolls summon Phantoms from the Shadow Plane, the original masters of Shadow Weaving.
Now with the coming God, the Troldsvar are finally ready to leave their forests and cover the world in darkness."
#summary "Race: Troldsvar. Regenerating, significantly weaker when exposed to light, and weak to fire.
Military: Troldsvar and Shadows, sacred Shadowbound, powerful Phantom summons. Poor when not fighting in darkness.

#descr "Much has been gleamed by the Meteor Druids by observing and studying the movement of the stars. With this ritual, a skilled Meteor Druid can reach for the starlit sky and pull down a star from the firmaments, and guide it towards a desired location, often with devastating consequences. The falling star will shatter in countless little pieces as it nears the ground that will wreak havoc among any of those unfortunate enough to be caught present. Performing this ritual is no easy task as it requires both great skill and immense timing and prediction on the part of the Meteor Druid to hit a moving army."
#details "Seventy five meteors strike any army located in the province. This attack occurs after regular movement phase and thus any army moving out of the targeted province won't be hit. If cast on the besieged fort, it will strike the sieging army. Furthermore, 8% of the population in the province will be killed, unrest will increase by 30, and there is a 20% chance that either a lab or temple get destroyed."

In the arduous years of training and torment, the mages of Edranor learn more than just the steep price of power, and how to transmute their emotions into magic.

#descr "In an undertaking of a full month, a towering stone pillar is erected and inscribed with countless sophisticated, gossamer-thin magical symbols, each of which holds considerable power on its own. After the delicate work has been completed and the entire surface of the pillar has been completely overlain with these intricate sigils, the pillar will begin to hum with power, the weave finally complete. The myriad of magical symbols woven into a great tapestry will work in harmony, flowing into one another and giving purpose to the pillar.
The Pillar of Plenty is inscribed with magical symbols that allow it to act as a magical focus which draws upon the magic of the Spheres in order to create a small quantity of pearls and gold."
#details "A Pillar of Plenty generates 1-3 Astral gems and 10-30 gold per turn. This bonus will not be visible in either gem or gold income. Only a single Pillar of Plenty will have effect in any single province."

#name "Rip Asunder"
#descr "Rip Asunder is a flawed ascension ritual, stemming from early research into transcendence. Though it works after a fashion, the end result is less than desirable in just about most circumstances, for those who undergo it are purged of their very souls and left and become husks of their former selves, ones physically imposing and powerful, but husks none the less. In times of need the mages of Edranor will willingly sacrifice themselves to become the Sundered if there is no other way of prevailing."

A willing mage is simultaneously imbued with magic and set ablaze with astral fires that ceaselessly continue to burn away at him during a month long ritual. This is rarely done however as the magical expenditure of such a ritual is often very costly, and the sheer agony of it beyond human comprehension and something very few even among the mages of Edranor can endure."

With their dying breath, the impaled mage will project the torment endured on the amplifier across the lands, and overwhelm an enemy army with sudden and excruciating torment. Though those affected suffer no real harm, the mental attack can still leaves horrible scars on their psyche."
#details "The army in the targeted province is attacked in a one round mock battle and a battle" -- wide effect is applied to the enemy force. An individual easy to negate MR roll for Weakness, Battle Fright, Mute, Feeble Minded, and Never Healing Wound is made against each unit.

The number of vessels created depends on the number of sacrifices, for it takes as many as a hundred people to create but a single Arcane Vessel, though the skill of the mages performing the syphoning process may greatly influence the imbuing process as well, as more powerful mages are capable of creating a far greater number of Arcane Vessels with the same number of sacrifices."

#descr "In the Golden Age of the Dwarfs it is said that even minor Dwarfholds could field multiple Runesmiths each with an Anvil of Doom, an enchanted anvil that allowed the use of powerful Rune Magic on the battlefield and allowed the Dwarfs to overcome their magical disadvantages. As the Dwarf empire declined many of these artifacts were lost, the art of their enchantment and usage was taken to the grave by tradition-bound Runelords, or they simply lost their power. They are now a rare sight, though no less powerful than ever. At this crucial moment as the Dwarf seeks to restore their former glory, many Runelords have rediscovered methods to reactivate a dormant Anvil of Doom. With this enchantment the Runelord binds himself spiritually to an Anvil of Doom such that he might smite the foes of his people. Such is the sacred importance of the Anvil that a group of Runeguard will be assigned to protect the Runelord and artifact both."

Rather than using the Ironbreaker hammer and shield they use Firedrakes, an invention of the Engineers Guild that is essentially a small battering ram capable of spraying a burning alchemical concoction on the ranks of the enemy. Though the Firedrake is a magnificent piece of craftsmanship it is not terribly accurate and as such the Irondrakes wear armour protected with runes which ward against fire and even protect their beards with segmented Gromril plates.

Those slain Dwarfs who are so barred from peace remain tied to their descendents as Ancestor Spirits able to provide advice and aid to them such that they might avenge the Great Grudge or complete tasks left undone. Though they are all greatly respected most Ancestor Spirits can only provide insubstantial help to their Clan in the form of their wisdom and blessings, or perhaps minor curses upon those that wrong them, but some Dwarfs, or Grudges, are so powerful that the Ancestor Spirit is able to manifest and seek direct vengeance in battle. This is particularly common with Kings, for the great wrongs done to a Clan or Dwarfkind in general may be taken as personal Grudges by rulers of sufficient authority. This spell will call upon the spirit of a great Dwarf hero from the Hall of Fame and grant him an ethereal form so that he may fight again and avenge his Grudges. Ancestor Spirits are not capable of using magic of any form, but are sacred and will retain any priestly authority."

However this time is long passed and now only old Thorek Ironbrow, the greatest living Runesmith, has the ability to strike the rune successfully - and even Thorek has sworn he will not risk striking it until his people have discovered a way to reactivate the many dormant Anvils of Doom, for doing so risks his own Anvil of Doom and the knowledge he has accumulated and not yet passed on. When struck the Master Rune of Doom will instantly plunge the battlefield into darkness as the power of the Ancestor Spirits is gathered and twelve Ancestor Spirits will emerge from around the Anvil determined to avenge their people."

The histories tell that the two races have fought in one another's cause since the time of the Daemon invasion, but legend carries the alliance deeper into the past. In some tales it was Talyn, King of the Eagles, who bore Ereth Khial, Goddess of the Underworld, to her ashen home at Asuryan's command. Like the High Elves, Great Eagles are haughty creatures of considerable intelligence and pride. By way of a ritual passed down through the generations a mage can formalise the ancient alliance by bonding a noble Great Eagle with a Prince of the High Elf aristocracy. The two will fight as one until their death, acting as both a general with a bird's eye view of battle and a terrifyingly swift and powerful combatant capable of attacking the enemies rear ranks."

Taking up such a Book of Grudges is a solemn and unbreakable vow to dedicate the rest of the Dwarf's long live to avenging them, at the exclusion of other duties, and as such is not a common practice. A forged Book of Grudges is such a commitment that it attracts the attention of Ancestor Spirits with a vested interest in seeing the grudges avenged and they lend their power to the bearer, rapidly healing their wounds, granting them sacred status in the eyes of other Dwarfs, and providing them with a blessing at all times.

Noble Vows. Your Paladins and Lords have a chance each turn to take up the Questing Vow, becoming a Questing Paladin/Lord. Questing Paladins/Lords then have a chance each turn to find the Grail and become a much more powerful Grail Paladin/Lord.
Questing Knights. The smallfolk of Bretonnia are often beset by raiders and fouls beasts, but many Questing Knights travel your lands. Each turn an unforted province you control within your dominion may lose some tax income that turn and gain some unrest, but in return you get one or more Questing Knights.
Pilgrims of the Lady. Each of your temmples represents a Grail Chapel dedicated to worship of the Lady. Pilgrims to these locations are common and occasionally they will be inspired to join your forces. The stronger your dominion in the province the more likely it is that a group of Pilgrims or Battle Pilgrims will spawn. Pilgrims are quite weak but numerous, while the less commmon Battle Pilgrims are sacred and of higher quality. This will happen silently, without triggering any message."

#msg "Welcome! The Dark Elves mod has some special mechanics which make them a little different from other nations:
Enslavement. When you conquer a province with a commander and 15+ troops and the province population is > 2000, some of the population are enslaved and sent to one of your forts, granting resources, gold, population, and battle slaves. With 20+ troops there is an event for population > 4000 and with 25+ an event for population > 6000. Each size of event can trigger 3 times each turn, for a total of 9 possible Enslavement events.
Corsair Coves. If a Corsair Captain is in a Dark Elf coastal province he might establish a Corsair Cove. This provides about 30 gold a turn, silently. If taken by an enemy it causes unrest for them, though they can dismantle it by reducing that unrest. If the unrest is high enough, Corsairs may attempt to retake the province for you. Coves on or neighbouring a fort are automatically dismantled.
Cult of Pleasure. Your forts can harbour the Cult of Pleasure, which starts quietly as Decadent Gatherings and grows over time. High dominion (yours or an enemies) can reduce the Cult, while low dominion encourages their growth, as does the presence of Pleasure Cultists. The Cult offers new recruitment options but can destroy your temple in the province, or worse."

#msg "Welcome! The Dwarfs mod has a special mechanic which makes them a little different from other nations:
Upgrading Capital Sites. Every turn in any mountain or cave province that you control and have positive dominion in there is a chance that a Lost site from the Golden Age of the Dwarfs will be unearthed (it will simply spawn, you don't need to search). There are three types of these Lost sites; Forge, Gold, and Gromril, corresponding to three of your starting capital sites. Each of these Lost sites has a chance each turn to be used to permanently upgrade the corresponding capital site. This can only happen if you control both the province with the Lost site and your capital province and have positive dominion in both - if you lose control of a province containing a Lost site it will be gone forever. Each capital site can be upgraded three times and each type of Lost site can only appear three times during a game, so if you want to fully upgrade all three capital sites you should be careful to protect them once they've appeared.
Forge give gems, Gromril gives gems and resources, Gold gives gold. A Forge or Gromril site upgraded to tier 3 or 4 will also allow you to recruit two Thunderers and two Irondrakes respectively each turn."
