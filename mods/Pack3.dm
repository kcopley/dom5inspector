More and more uneducated commoners seek out their fortune in the densely populated cities, looking for work in the numerous clockwork factories. On the other hand, those citizens who own the factories and the means of production, or hold particular sets of skills or a proper education find themselves becoming ever-richer and leading leisurely lives, far enough away from the polluted districts of the commoners, but still enjoying all the fruits of their labor. Among this new - bourgeoisie - class of citizens, fencing has become a favorite pastime and indeed a sport that seperates them from the greasy cogs that are the working class."

#descr "With the discovery of the ancient Antikytheran device and the industrial revolution that followed, an ever increasing number of people started to migrate towards packed and densely populated cities that rarely saw sunlight even on the brightest of days due to the sheer volume of smoke and soot in the air. The swift technological progress of the Imperium held the promise of a better life for all those who came seeking work, but delivered death instead. Where industry boomed disease and sickness followed. More and more people started to sicken and die from the fetid and metal-heavy air, overcrowding, and general poor living conditions. Diseases started to spread rampant and in a few short years the biggest cities of the Imperium were brought to their knees and cut in half. The lessons learned in those bleak years have now been put to use and now an increasing number of Plague Doctors ply their trade in the sprawling cities, helping keep the worst of the diseases at bay. The skills of the Plague Doctors are appreciated and indeed crucial for the well-being of the Imperium, though many are still unsettled at the sight of one, both due to their presence often heralding an outbreak of a sickness, but also because the memories of sinister-looking Plague Doctors dissecting the dead, walking on stilts over countless bodies that littered the streets and spraying them with strange chemicals are fresh in the minds of all those who survived the plagues that ravaged the cities."

The thick shell of the tanks is nearly indestructible and projectiles and swords will glance off it harmlessly. The alchemical compounds used to power the boiler are somewhat unstable and damaging the boiler can cause the steam tank to explode in a fiery fury that will burn anything in proximity to cinder. The inner-workings and mechanics of the Steam Tanks are extremely complex and it often takes several month to build even a single Steam Tank. Repairing a damaged Steam Tank is nearly impossible outside of the Clockwork Workshop and the engineers operating them can only make small repairs on critically damaged Steam Tanks.

A tremendously huge and imposing clockwork construct that surely comes as close to an artificial god as is possible to create. The Mechanical Lord is not affected by heat, cold, shock, or poison, and is layered in thick iron plates, making it nearly imperious to damage. The amount of magic needed to animate and keep such a powerful clockwork functional is far beyond what any mage can ever hope to muster and as such the Mechanical Lord is powered by many enchanted gemstones that keep its clockwork gears ever ticking. Even such a measure is not enough to fully support the great construct as the Mechanical Lord can only function for roughly six months before its core is completely depleted and its gears stop ticking. When such a scenario is near at hand a safety mechanism will automatically trigger and literally rip a hole in space and time, flinging the Mechanical Lord back to its home in order to recharge the gemstones animating the construct, a process that usually takes an additional whole six months to complete."

While Exemplars might not be the most powerful of the angels, they are certainly the most holy and virtues, and greatest of spirit. It is for this very reason that the Exemplars cannot be summoned into the mortal realm through various rituals unlike other angels. The Portal of Radiance may only be opened but for a brief moment and only by those pure of heart and through the greatest act of selflessness, self-sacrifice and martyrdom.
Much like all angelic beings, Exemplars too are unable to contain their greatness inside mortal vessels, and are thus much diminished in the mortal realm. Their wispy, tendrilous wings of pure white light and unable to carry them through the air, but rather surround them in a nimbus of greatness. Such is the holiness of the Exemplars that sinners will repent in their presence and turn away from their evil and misguided deeds.
A Martyr Saint must be present in the province in order to recruit Exemplars."

Their being shines with the divine powers that surge through their fragile, earthly bodies and to look upon the obscure, shifty figure of the Saint is to know peace and tranquility. Surrounded by an aura of holiness the Saint levitates through the air, his feet never touching the ground. Saints posses powerful magical powers as well as divine. In times of crises and great strife a Saint will willingly and selflessly sacrifice himself and die a Martyr in order to save others.

These bone golems are capable of increasing their size by feasting on corpses and incorporating them into their repulsive forms. They are even capable of devouring a corpse or a limb during battle in order to quickly reconstitute themselves. However, while the Bone Widows themselves are huge and difficult to slay, the necromancers riding them are notably not, as they rely only on weak shielding spells for protection. Should the necromancer riding it die, the giant spider-like bone golem will fall apart into its composing parts."

They were once valiant knights and brave heroes of various lands who sought to bring order and justice to the world. All the more deep-felt was their treachery when they instead broke their sacred oaths and duties, and discarded their humanity. Now, they are cursed souls who have far since abandoned last vestiges of hope and redemption and have fully given in to malice, corruption and hatred. Though the Blazing Wardens were once men, they now appear as towering skeletal giants engulfed in a perpetual searing flame, a physical manifestation of the evil that has grown to gigantic properties within their cursed souls over the long centuries.

They are capable of finding ways inside forts, castles, and tightly guarded hiding places. Luck favors these creatures even in a land such as Hollowmoor - where all fortune seems to invert, as Black Cats often avoid killing blows by the breadth of a hair, leering all the while. Black Cats have a profound dislike of water and refuse to cross rivers."

They rarely outright try to kill, but rather take great delight in frightening their victims until their frail hearts give out, or Hollows come to devour their terror-filled souls, now blazing like a great bonfire, clearly visible to Hollows.
The Scarecrows are believed to be able to distort perception of those around them, as surely that is more believable than distorting the very reality. Projected images of the Scarecrows will dance around the battlefield, jumping out and terrorizing all those around them, including allied troops."

Whatever the case may be, the end product is still the same; a bloodthirsty and gore-covered being that goes around decapitating heads with grim satisfaction, and bloody scythe in hand. The blood-soaked sight of a Pumpkin Lord is a terrifying one to behold in battle. They seem capable of commanding any type of monster and as such often lead the misfit monsters of Hollowmoor into battle under the directions of the Dark Lords. Pumpkin Lords take great delight participating in annual Autumn Harvests, when they ride into the open countryside and farmlands, and compete in their own twisted blood sports.
Each Autumn, the Pumpkin Lords can venture out into the open plains and farmland provinces to conduct their gruesome annual Autumn Harvest, capturing many virgins, killing many, and raising many Pumpkinheads from the slayed in the process. The Autumn Harvest is conducted at the height of each month of Autumn."

Buttressed by a harrowing life with but sparse moments of respite and contentment, they know that the grim tales of runaway children and misfortunate waifs who frequently end up boiled alive and cooked into stew in the horrifying Bubbling Cauldron are no tales at all in Hollowmoor, and if anything, are probably much milder than the distressing reality of what becomes of those who chance such a horror.
The sickening content of the great cauldron tells a disturbing end of all the souls it has consumed over the many years. Believed to have been enchanted by a particularly twisted Wizened Hag who took great delight in boiling children alive and seasoning her stew with their blood-curdling wails, the cauldron is able to move of its own dark purpose, ever looking for more ingredients, even though its owner has long since perished. It is said that the Bubbling Cauldron grows just a little bigger with every fresh chuck of meat added to its ever-swelling volume, and that those unfortunate enough to be slowly cooked by it are not released even upon their horrifying death, as the vile animation continues to simmer and slowly devour their souls for many years to come. The Bubbling Cauldron is constantly surrounded by a foul, deathly miasma of overcooked human meat, and all those who come too close to it will fall violently ill. The agonizing howls of all those wretched souls trapped within the great cauldron can be heard from many miles away, and are a dire a warning to flee as there is."

#descr "The children of Hollowmoor are a precocious bunch, having been robbed of their childish innocence and faced with a reality no child, or indeed man, should have to face. Buttressed by a harrowing life with but sparse moments of respite and contentment, they know that the grim tales of runaway children and misfortunate waifs who frequently end up boiled alive and cooked into stew in the horrifying Bubbling Cauldron are no tales at all in Hollowmoor, and if anything, are probably much milder than the distressing reality of what becomes of those who chance such a horror.
The sickening content of the great cauldron tells a disturbing end of all the souls it has consumed over the many years. Believed to have been enchanted by a particularly twisted Wizened Hag who took great delight in boiling children alive and seasoning her stew with their blood-curdling wails, the cauldron is able to move of its own dark purpose, ever looking for more ingredients, even though its owner has long since perished. It is said that the Bubbling Cauldron grows just a little bigger with every fresh chuck of meat added to its ever-swelling volume, and that those unfortunate enough to be slowly cooked by it are not released even upon their horrifying death, as the vile animation continues to simmer and slowly devour their souls for many years to come. The Bubbling Cauldron is constantly surrounded by a foul, deathly miasma of overcooked human meat, and all those who come too close to it will fall violently ill. The agonizing howls of all those wretched souls trapped within the great cauldron can be heard from many miles away, and are a dire a warning to flee as there is."

They rarely outright try to kill but rather take great delight in frightening their victims until their frail hearts give out, or Hollows come to devour their terror-filled souls.
The Scarecrows are believed to be able to distort perception of those around them, as surely that is more believable than distorting the very reality. Projected images of the Scarecrows will dance around the battlefield, jumping out and terrorizing all those around them, including allied troops."

At times, she may be seen at night as a shrouded woman, crouched beneath the trees, lamenting with veiled face, or floating past in the moonlight, crying bitterly. And the cry of this spirit is mournful beyond all other sounds on earth, and betokens certain death to some member of the family whenever it is heard in the silence of the night."

Now, though the room still exists within her aged and dilapidated castle, its occupants have faded to a blurred silhouette and hazy echoes just like the Spirit of Sorrows's memory of what, or rather who was locked there. Though nothing but dust, cobwebs, and an uneasy haze of sorrow linger about in the now open reliquary, something else stirs other than her dying recollection. Faceless spectres, not unlike Hollows themselves roam this deep crevice of the keep, whom follow the Spirit of Sorrow as so to confound her with her inability to remember their meaning.

Through his remarkable valor and resourcefulness he won the respect of his fellow soldiers and was soon elevated to to the rank of a minor lord and given the thankless task of protecting the war-torn disputed border lands between the empire and its century-long rival. It was a task the new lord performed exceptionally for years on end, despite the ever-dwindling support from the emperor, and the constant plotting and ridicule of the pretentious aristocracy that hated him for his common ancestry. His prowess and the vigor with which he sought to protect the common people of the land won him the hatred of both the enemies across the border, and his supposed allies. Threatened by the young lord's tactical genius and accomplishments, the emperor sent him to sign a peace treaty with their arch-nemesis in his stead, not knowing that he himself would indeed be part of the peace accord. Betrayed by his countrymen, he was promptly chained and manacled like a dog. Though he was beaten senseless and tortured for a full year, his resolve never buckling, and he never broke. It remained so, until the enemies he had gathered, the lords, ladies and emperors of both realms - those who so wished to see him broken and humiliated - presented him with a sight that instantly shattered his sanity, the still screaming and twitching sight of his impaled family. The young lord broke free from his shackles that day, and a dark shadow fell upon both empires. Much transpired in the following years, all of it horrifying and sickening to the core. Impaled corpses littered the landscape of both crumbling realms, and the Impaler's power had become such that those impaled could not stop their wails of agony even in their death.
The Impaler is exceptionally skilled at pillaging provinces and can create horrid creatures known as the Impaled that continue their wails of torment well into death while doing so."

She was born as the youngest and only female heir to a rather powerful ruler whom fate had bestowed numerous children. Being raised in such a fiercely competitive environment with many brothers, she quickly picked up the sword and shield, instead of the much expected needle and twine, much to the dismay of the court and her royal parents. The Baroness showed great proclivity for swordplay and all things military, and even though she was uniquely gifted, much more so than any of her numerous brothers, attempts were made to sequester her from her foolish dreams. Forced to peruse her interests in unlikely and unsavory places for somebody of her status, the Baroness quickly became a social pariah, an outcast everybody ridiculed and shunned. Even among the lowly, dull-witted commoners she was considered a laughing stock. When the old emperor finally passed away and his many sons began to feud and grapple for power, the foolish little girl obsessed with swordplay was thrown out of the royal palace and stricken from everyone's mind. In that hate-filled instant the Baroness decided to unleash devastation and slaughter upon her whole royal family. Unleashing a torrent of blood and murder, she quickly ascended to the empire's throne, with a blood-stained dress and sword in hand, before the Mists took her.
No weapon that Baroness ever picked up was for long left unmastered by her. She is believed to even be able to manipulate the very Mists of Hollowmoor, and use them to conceal her troops, and keep them hidden from enemy scouts."

According to ancient records, the Death Knight was once a valiant prince of a small realm, happily married with a beautiful princess, rumored to posses the gift of foresight, with whom he awaited a child. One night his wife dreamt a terrible cataclysm that would tear the kingdom apart, and which only her beloved husband could stop, but at the cost of his life. Upon hearing these dire prediction he swore such a future would not come to pass and that he would save the realm and thus his family, and set off on his noble quest. On the way, he encountered three witches who slowly poisoned the young prince's mind with lies about his wife's infidelity. They prompted to mock him about his naivety, setting off on a wild-goose chase while his whore of a wife gave birth to a bastardly child. Having finally succumb to the witches' lies, the now enraged young prince turned from his selfless quest to save the realm and went back to confront his wife, and the newborn babe she was now cradling in her arms, just as the cataclysm began. In the ensuing devastation, a chandelier fell on his wife, causing a great fire and setting her aflame. As she burned to death, his wife only begged for him to save their child and take him away from the spreading flames, but in the young prince's moment of indecision and doubt the flames engulfed the child, consuming him alongside his wailing mother. With her last dying breath his wife cursed him to live out the lifetimes of all the souls whose death could have been averted by him on that cursed day had he not fallen into madness, and upon pronouncing the curse the young prince was set aflame and swept away by strange mists, along with the three witches who had poisoned his mind - now risen as Banshees, cursed to remind him of his folly every night until the curse is broken."

#descr "The Spirit of Sorrow is one of the Dark Lords of Hollowmoor. She is the most ancient of the Dark Lords and her fate is the least known one for even the numerous books dedicated to her transgressions have long since turned to dust. It is unclear whether the cursed prison of Hollowmoor was specifically created to keep her confined or whether there were perhaps other Dark Lords before her, now complete forgotten and faded. Her very presence seems to either announce or directly cause the birth of Lamenting Ghosts, which call her 'Mother' though blood-curdling wailing shrieks. Due to this, many believe the Spirit of Sorrow to be the very first Banshee, and the mother of all heralding spirits. Great sorrow hides behind her mournful and empty eye sockets, seeming to speak of some ancient and terrible tragedy that even now, countless centuries later, still torments the spirit."

#descr "The Butcher of Nightmares was born a simple farm child, to a loving mother and a cruel, abusive father. As he grew up he was tasked with the responsibility of tending to the animals, work he thoroughly enjoyed. But as the years passed and the little boy matured a day came where his father bid him assume other responsibilities, those of slaughtering the farmyard animals that he so loved. Horrified at the prospect of killing his beloved friends, the now adolescent rebelled against his wicked father. That dark day, it is said, the boy died and a monster took his place. As punishment for his rebelliousness the boy's father made him perform hideous vivisection on the still living and twitching animals, until the boy's eyes were completely dry of tears, and were now filled with something dark and sinister. In the following years the boy went on to became a famous butcher, one taking great pride in his abilities and skill with the cleaver. It took many years after people first started disappearing for the truth to come out. The Butcher's dark appetites were finally discovered when he was accidentally caught quite literally red-handed, in the midst of a vast slaughterhouse, full of countless hooked rotting corpses, dismembered animal and human part, and the overpowering, putrid smell of blood that permeated throughout the entire building.
The Butcher of Nightmares is capable of chopping off limbs in a single strike and all those who follow him will bask in his bloodlust. His blood-stained apron and monstrous appearance is horrifying to behold on the battlefield. His legend and tales of his slaughter have grown to such proportion that he has received a substantial cult following from all sorts of twisted and sick individuals who try to follow in his footsteps, hook and cleaver in hand."

#descr "The Flesh Angel was once but a young and very plain mage with no ambition or aspirations for anything other than mediocrity. Her entire life was always quite unremarkable in every shape and form, until one day she first laid her eyes upon a handsome young lord. Immediately she was smitten and fell in love with him, but sadly the feeling was not reciprocated. Such as she was she could never hope to win his heart, so she sought to make herself irresistible by using dark and forbidden magic. Inexperienced and average as she was in everything, she failed to perform the complex ritual correctly. The weaving was a success, but it was too much of a success. Her beauty transcended that of the Divines. To look upon her was to feel unreasonable wanton and carnal desire. Soon she was nicknamed the Angel of Beauty and no man was without lust for her. Terrible and unimaginable things were then done to her by the men of the city, but perhaps nothing that happened was more terrible than what the women of the city did to her. While her beauty stirred up lust and desire in all men, it awoke pure, unadulterated hatred and jealousy in the hearts of the simple women of the city. They captured her and mutilated her body, ripping the flesh and skin of her back with metal spikes to resemble wings. They turned her into an ironic mockery of an angel, but even in that horrible instant, the weaving she had wrought never abated and stopped enchanting those who saw her. She became the Flesh Angel, a creature horrifying to behold, yet irresistible. The things that were done to her shattered her fragile mind and turned her into an abomination.
Now, the Flesh Angel feeds on the lust of men, and vitriol of women. Her horrifying beauty plagues their dreams, and she is able to enter them and devour their souls to feed her blackened and hollow heart."

Some believe these dead sailors to be the most notorious of all pirate crews who refused to lay to rest and abandon their deleterious way of life even in death, while others yet think them crews cursed by the Sea Crones or even the Sea Goddess herself to sail the seas until such time the seas dry up. Whatever the case may be, these risen pirates and their terrible captains strike fear into the hearts of all men.

The Shantymen improve the morale of all sailors on long voyages and sing songs of merriment that help pass the time. In battles however, the Shantymen sing completely different types of songs that reverberate and hum with power; songs spoken through dry and salty mouths and in strange words. Those pirates who hear these spell-songs find themselves empowered by them. There are many types of sea shanties and many strange languages they are sung in, and none know them all. Each Shantyman typically only has an affinity for a single type of shanties and thus all Shantymen specialize those types they show talent for. The Shantyman is the second-most crucial member of a ship's crew, after the captain, and it is said that a good Shantyman is worth at least ten extra hands in battle."

It is their strong and ruthless personalities as well as their exceptional fighting skills that keep them at the top of the pirate hierarchy for many years, until they are eventually replaced by more cunning and ambitious pirates. Pirate Kings fully enjoy the privileges of their position and gladly indulge in the company of virgins they've successively 'lured' into their beds. Through their reputations they command great respect from their underlings and fill their enemies with dread. Bards and storytellers have made fortunes singing songs and telling tales of Pirate Kings who've single-handedly looted entire settlements, getting away with barely a scratch, overfilled coffers and the local Lord's daughters. Though Pirate Kings care little for religious pomp and ceremony, it is not uncommon that at times, when winds are unfavorable, they will offer human sacrifices to appease the Sea. The ships of Pirate Kings are naturally the largest and best ships in Tortuga. These wooden monstrosities often carry dozens of cannons and various other armaments."

#descr "Besides numerous other forms and illusions, a Crone can take on the the form of a siren as well. Unlike regular sirens the Crone's scales are black as the waters she was reborn in. While on land in the form of a siren the Crone's powers are considerably diminished, however, this shape enables her to cover great distance with speed, and should danger arise she can simply hide or change back shape. Contrary to the Crone's spell casting abilities in siren shape while on land, in sea, her mastery over water grows."

With the coming of the new god of Tortuga new tales of conquest and plunder spread like wildfire. In the far reaches of the world, under a distant sky and strange seas, the Flibustier set sail for the ports of Tortuga once again, eager to add their sails to those of the new sea god. Flibustiers are veteran pirates. They are well known for donning flamboyant attire and openly displaying their wealth. Unlike most pirates, the Flibustiers are used to carrying somewhat heavier armor in battle, despite the added risk on the high seas."

Sightings of rotten and long-since sunken pirate ships navigated by dead and infamous pirate kings and their notorious crews are common tales in pirate taverns of Tortuga. Some believe these dead sailors to be the most notorious of all pirate crews who refused to lay to rest and abandon their deleterious way of life even in death, while others yet think them crews cursed by the Sea Crones or even the Sea Goddess herself to sail the seas until such time the seas dry up. Whatever the case may be, these risen pirates and their terrible captains strike fear into the hearts of all men.

Despite many accounts and fanciful stories told about it over the long years, few are those who actually believe it to be real, for few are those who ever survive to tell the tale of the Ghost Ship and its damned crew. But every so often lone survivor appear to once again stoke interest and tell outlandish tales of a bulking monstrosity of a ship suddenly appearing in the harbor, silently gliding above the cold dark waters, shimmering in the night. Though the tales of new sightings are rare and far between, they often sound eerily similar and talk of a cursed ship that always appears during the darkest of nights, with little to no moonlight, and heavy overcast skies, always accompanied by thick, obscuring mists, and the eventual incredulous wails of those who encounter it. The grave silence of its arrival is rarely broken by alarm bells, but rather the deafening sound of its cannon barrage. The Ghost Ship is said to carry as many cannons as a full Tortugan armada - if not more - and a sweeping tide of damned pirates, that seemingly pour out of the ship endlessly, an outrageous claim in its own right."

They operate by sailing to distant lands and smuggling forbidden and thus highly valued goods in exchange for exorbitant amounts of gold. Such shady dealings and disposal of large quantities of contraband can usually take anywhere from a single month, up to several, depending on the goods being delivered. Upon concluding his business the Smuggler will sail back to one of the Tortugan ports with great riches in tow. Smugglers are experts at procuring forbidden goods and as such good fortune will surely befall any province they're located in as riches slowly trickle in. Though Smugglers operate alone they do on occasion employ Madman as bodyguards.
*A Smuggler may be sneaked into a fortified enemy coastal province in order to acquire large sums of gold by selling contraband. The Smuggler has a 25 percent chance of finalizing his business each passing month, and upon completion can sail back to a friendly Tortugan fortified coastal province to deliver a large but varying amount of gold and even gems."

#descr "Miss Fortune is a vicious mercenary whose exploits are well-known across the Seven Seas, and perhaps one of the few Tortugan pirates whose reputation in distant lands is greater than in the ports of Tortuga. Even as a little girl she always dreamed of leaving Tortuga and sailing the Seven Seas and all the exotic places beyond. When she came of age - which is to say when she took her first life on the streets of Tortuga - Miss Fortune decided that she had an affinity for such work and became a bounty hunter. Over the years she used her considerable talents and even more considerable charm to collect many bounties in one song-worthy adventure after the other, which let her fulfill her childish dream of explore the whole of world. Those she hunted grew to calling her misfortune, as any who were on her list would quickly meet their demise. Her reputation and deeds grew and eventually word of them reached back to the now distant ports of Tortuga. Now Pirates of Fortune flock to her sails for a chance to hunt and raid with the infamous Miss Fortune and share in her spoils and glory."

After a song-worthy raid of a very wealthy noble's house, Jacob retired from piracy and started a life of extravagance, lavish balls and philandering. Though the wealth he had looted from the noble was considerable, a veritable king's ransom, his expensive tastes proved to be a fair deal more considerable. His rapidly dwindling treasure allowed him to defile only so many noble women before being faced with utter financial ruin and ostracization from the high society he had grown so accustomed to. When finally faced with the reality of his newly destitute situation, Jacob decided to pull off just one more raid before retiring again, for good this time, and returning to his leisurely way of life. Jacob has come out of retirement several times so far."

However, there are some that take a much keener interest in worldly matters. Tess was once a gifted young witch who used her immense knowledge of foresight and her feminine wiles to uproot a Pirate King and establish herself in his stead as a Pirate Queen. Over the years her popularity and prominence among the pirates has risen considerably, as have her witching powers. A skilled pirate in her own right, cunning, and gifted with arcane and mystical powers, Tess is a force to be reckoned with, and is well known across the Seven Seas, as even the most ruthless of the Pirate Kings pay her due respect."

#descr "Fashionably Late Triple Barrel Jack, commonly known as 'The Crazy Cannoneer', is the most famous pirate cannoneer. Since his earliest days before he could barely hold a cutlass in his hand, Jack was fascinated with cannons, bombs, and all things incendiary. Nothing else but his love for explosions ever held his attention, not even the latest pirate fashions, bejeweling cutlasses, falchions and fine silken clothes looted from nobles of distant shores. Upon reaching manhood, Jack's father - a moderately successful pirate with a humble treasure - presented him with a cannon. Since then, Jack's fascination and interest in cannons continued to grow, and he eventually matured into the best cannoneer among all the pirates. This fascination eventually turned into an obsession that made many pirates whisper that the Crazy Cannoneer would caress his cannons more lovingly than a man could any a woman, for he spent more and more time with these metal behemoths of death, always improving, adjusting, and maintaining them. Some even said that he slept in the arms of his cold mistresses, the barrels of the cannons. In recent years, Jack completely withdrew from the pirate society to the solitude of his cannon workshop and rumor had it he was onto something big. Now, with the arrival of the new pirate god of Tortuga, Jack has emerged from his hermitage to offer his services anew and present his newest invention, the triple barrel cannon. Now, Fashionably Late Triple Barrel Jack serves the new God as one of his most trusted servants in an effort to plunder the world."

The stories say that his greed and will to set the world aflame was so strong that not even death could hope to stop him. Both afraid and fascinated by the Nightmare of the Deep Fathom, pirates and sailors across the Seven Seas began to secretly worship him as though he was a god, either hoping to be spared his wrath, or to join in his misdeeds, inspired by such a terrifying captain. In but a few moons the Seven Seas were plunged into chaos and the world was fraught with terror. Furious at this impudence, the Pantokrator banished the Night of the Deep Fathom to the deepest and darkest recesses of the seas for an eternity. Now that the Pantokrator is gone, the Nightmare of the Deep Fathom has emerged from the depths to yet again pillage the world and receive the prayers of men. Terror and misfortune will spread in any province he is located in."

The spirit is very quick to reform its watery body and will quite literally wash away any seeming injury made to its assumed form. Though completly unable to leave the fountain it inhabits, the spirit can still posses other living beings in its proximity in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items or performing enchantments.

The Last King is a powerful mage and a seasoned warrior but was never loved or considered an adequate nor capable leader. He was quickly given the title 'Weak' by the people for losing the Kingdom to the dark God. Every fortnight or so a servant girl would go missing from the palace hence it was widely believed that Goldo dabbled in the forbidden arts of blood magic. Some believe that his beastly use of blood magic attracted the dark God in the first place and awoke his hunger and lust for the kingdom's riches and knowledge. The Last King is a masterful blood mage and is able to call horrors to his side during battle. Misfortune will befall any province he is located in."

Though the abilities the Spellbinders possess are indeed incapable of directly killing their victims, they very often do so none the less, and are not as benign as the others consider them to be. The Spellbinders are capable of projecting powerful illusions and clouding the minds of their enemies, making them believe that an enemy soldier stands where but a second ago a friend stood, a trick that typically ends up disrupting and thinning enemy lines. The Spellbinders are the only ones of the ranks of the Venari that have remained true to their original purpose and name, a fact mildly ironic given that the ones who have remained true to their name have lost it in the process."

They can leech the life force of others to replenish themselves and even use their powers to open gashing cuts upon scores of enemies at once through sheer willpower and hatred. When seriously wounded in combat, and near death's door, the Possessed enter a type of blood frenzy, their flowing wounds now used to fuel their magical abilities all the more. Once in such a state the Possessed are capable of draining the life force of those they've wounded in order to instantly heal themselves. There are many frightening tales of the Possessed suffering numerous killing cuts and wound only to literally rip apart their enemies in the ensuing blood frenzy and emerge unscathed.

This great spire was created by the Dreamers long ago, while still trying to rediscover the long lost secret of Ascension in an effort to prevent the remaining people of Edranor from being slaughtered. It is while searching for this arcane secret that the Dreamers accidentally uncovered the Dreamlands, a transcendental plane of existence. Now, the Dreamers spend all their waking hours in the Void Chamber, which incidentally grow fewer and fewer all the time as the Dreamers have no interest in the physical world, instead choosing to spend the majority of their lives exploring the Dreamlands and trying to ascend to higher planes of existence. As such, it is little wonder that the physical bodies of the Dreamers are atrophied and often too weak to even leave the Void Chamber after suffering prolonged bouts of Dreamwalking and years of neglect from their owners, despite having been endowed with the same strength like all others who pass the Harrowing. Many of those who return from the Dreamlands often find their frail and abandoned bodies weakened even more from the prolonged neglect, now pilled with afflictions. While navigating the Dreamlands, the Dreamers remain completely invisible until they manifest to yank their unsuspecting victims into the Dreamlands with them. However, spending too much time in the Dreamlands can be very dangerous and is guaranteed to attract unwanted attention for the Dreamlands are a living place and will sense those who trespass. Dreamers are few in number and are often considered mad by the mages of Edranor. Most of those who join their ranks also seem to be male, eluding that perhaps the rational mind takes precedence for Dreamwalking than one ruled by the maelstrom of emotions."

Now, the Dreamers spend all their waking hours in the Void Chamber, which incidentally grow fewer and fewer all the time as the Dreamers have no interest in the physical world, instead choosing to spend the majority of their lives exploring the Dreamlands and trying to ascend to higher planes of existence. As such, it is little wonder that the physical bodies of the Dreamers are atrophied and often too weak to even leave the Void Chamber after suffering prolonged bouts of Dreamwalking and years of neglect from their owners, despite having been endowed with the same strength like all others who pass the Harrowing. Many of those who return from the Dreamlands often find their frail and abandoned bodies weakened even more from the prolonged neglect, now pilled with afflictions. While navigating the Dreamlands, the Dreamers remain completely invisible until they manifest to yank their unsuspecting victims into the Dreamlands with them. However, spending too much time in the Dreamlands can be very dangerous and is guaranteed to attract unwanted attention for the Dreamlands are a living place and will sense those who trespass. Dreamers are few in number and are often considered mad by the mages of Edranor. Most of those who join their ranks also seem to be male, eluding that perhaps the rational mind takes precedence for Dreamwalking than one ruled by the maelstrom of emotions."

#name "Avatar of Vengeance"
#descr "When the Dreamers failed to rediscover the means of ascension, all hope for leading the people of Edranor from the brink of ruin was lost. In a last act of defiance the people of Edranor turned away from ascension and escape for good and settled for vengeance. In a grand and bloody ritual, which would later be known as the very first Harrowing, the mages of Edranor invaded the Demon Realms, and acquired the means of vengeance. Most of those who attempted the first Harrowing died either in the crossing, or while facing the demonic spirits, but the few survivors who made it back acquired incredible demonic powers and became the very avatars of vengeance and retribution. It is by unleashing their unadulterated fury and rage that the people of Edranor found their salvation for the second time in history. Ever since, the Harrowing has become a coming of power rituals all mages undergo at one point or other. Though it was never made mandatory, it is unheard of for someone not to attempt it, for the price of power is well known and gladly paid. Avatars of Vengeance are the ones who know it best and who have payed the heaviest price. The vast and mysterious powers of the Avatars of Vengeance are a closely held secret. In truth, the Avatars are not fully human. Not all emerge from the Harrowing equally. Some mages are faced with lesser demons of limited powers, and some are faced with greater ones. Some are even plunged so deep into the Demon Realm that they lose all hope of returning to their corporeal bodies in time, regardless of the powers acquired. And then there are those that would become the Avatars of Vengeance, the mages that would not only take the vanquished demon's power and strength, but also devour its heart, absorbing the demon within themselves and thus gaining powers not akin to most. When an Avatar of Vengeance emerges from the Harrowing she is watched very closely for many weeks and executed if the tiniest influence of the demon within is detected."

#descr "The Manifestation is a demonic spirit unleashed from its prison, the body of an Avatar of Vengeance, through one last act of sacrifice.Though finally freed in the Terrestrial Sphere, the envious Manifestation will continue to emulate its former keeper and take on her characteristics and mannerisms, wishing to become her. The difference between the demon and the Avatar can indeed be negligible, especially considering the violent proclivities of the Avatars gladly shared by their demonic inhabitants; an unsettling fact not easily accepted and the main reason the choices made during the Harrowing rituals by the Avatars are a closely guarded secret that could potentially cause a rift within Edranor itself. As the Avatars of Vengeance were no simple mages during their life, but mages that embodies the concept of Vengeance, who made it their identity, so will the Manifestation take that mantle, becoming the vengeful demonic spirit of Edranor. Manifestations are capable of entering a blood frenzy, and the closer they are to death the more dangerous and powerful they become."

The difference between the demon and the Avatar can indeed be negligible, especially considering the violent proclivities of the Avatars gladly shared by their demonic inhabitants; an unsettling fact not easily accepted and the main reason the choices made during the Harrowing rituals by the Avatars are a closely guarded secret that could potentially cause a rift within Edranor itself. As the Avatars of Vengeance were no simple mages during their life, but mages that embodies the concept of Vengeance, who made it their identity, so will the Manifestation take that mantle, becoming the vengeful demonic spirit of Edranor. Manifestations are capable of entering a blood frenzy, and the closer they are to death the more dangerous and powerful they become."

The difference between the demon and the Avatar can indeed be negligible, especially considering the violent proclivities of the Avatars gladly shared by their demonic inhabitants; an unsettling fact not easily accepted and the main reason the choices made during the Harrowing rituals by the Avatars are a closely guarded secret that could potentially cause a rift within Edranor itself. As the Avatars of Vengeance were no simple mages during their life, but mages that embodies the concept of Vengeance, who made it their identity, so will the Manifestation take that mantle, becoming the vengeful demonic spirit of Edranor. Manifestations are capable of entering a blood frenzy, and the closer they are to death the more dangerous and powerful they become."

#descr "Many of those who survive the Harrowing believe that the Possessed steal much more from their demonic manifestations than just their powers; perhaps their corrupted souls as well. As such, it is little wonder that these mages are widely rumored to be more demon in nature than human after the completion of the ritual. There are even those who think the Possessed indeed are demons, those that devoured the mage souls during the Harrowing and somehow found a link back to their corporeal bodies in the Terrestrial plane. Whatever the case may be the Possessed truly do wield frightening demonic-like powers. Their abilities are grounded in Blood magic and vampirism. They are capable of projecting bolts of pure agony at their enemies that either leave them dead, or soon to be. The Possessed seemingly feed on the anguish of others and are reinvigorated by the screams and agony of those they slay. They can leech the life force of others to replenish themselves and even use their powers to open gashing cuts upon scores of enemies at once through sheer willpower and hatred. When seriously wounded in combat, and near death's door, the Possessed enter a type of blood frenzy, their flowing wounds now used to fuel their magical abilities all the more. Once in such a state a Possessed is capable of draining the life force of those he cuts in order to instantly heal himself. There are many frightening tales of the Possessed suffering numerous killing cuts and wound only to literally rip apart their enemies in the ensuing blood frenzy and emerge unscathed. Much like all mages of Edranor, the abilities of the Possessed are also fueled by physical strength and the deep well of hatred and vengeance."

#descr "When the Dreamers failed to rediscover the means of ascension, all hope for leading the people of Edranor from the brink of ruin was lost. In a last act of defiance the people of Edranor turned away from ascension and escape for good and settled for vengeance. In a grand and bloody ritual, which would later be known as the very first Harrowing, the mages of Edranor invaded the Demon Realms, and acquired the means of vengeance. Most of those who attempted the first Harrowing died either in the crossing, or while facing the demonic spirits, but the few survivors who made it back acquired incredible demonic powers and became the very avatars of vengeance and retribution. It is by unleashing their unadulterated fury and rage that the people of Edranor found their salvation for the second time in history. Ever since, the Harrowing has become a coming of power rituals all mages undergo at one point or other. Though it was never made mandatory, it is unheard of for someone not to attempt it, for the price of power is well known and gladly paid. Avatars of Vengeance are the ones who know it best and who have payed the heaviest price. The vast and mysterious powers of the Avatars of Vengeance are a closely held secret. In truth, the Avatars are not fully human. Not all emerge from the Harrowing equally. Some mages are faced with lesser demons of limited powers, and some are faced with greater ones. Some are even plunged so deep into the Demon Realm that they lose all hope of returning to their corporeal bodies in time, regardless of the powers acquired. And then there are those that would become the Avatars of Vengeance, the mages that would not only take the vanquished demon's power and strength, but also devour its heart, absorbing the demon within themselves and thus gain powers not akin to most. When an Avatar of Vengeance emerges from the Harrowing she is watched very closely for many weeks and executed if the tiniest influence of the demon within is detected."

The only thing the mages of Edranor believe in is power, and more recently, vengeance. The mage-folk of Edranor spread their dominion over the lands not through faith, but by dominating others, cowing their enemies into submission through great fear of reprisals and displays of their god-like powers. There is no mistaking the borders of Edranor, for every corner of their land is marked by the imposing and numerous Blood Obelisks which act as temples in their own right. They are the instrument through which Edranor spreads dominion over the lands, and by performing sadistic and unspeakable rituals the Blood Obelisks can be made to pulsate with a dark, blood-red colour and hum with the agonizing screams of all those the mages of Edranor have taken vengeance upon. Though the mages of Edranor are no more cruel than needed when the situation arises, they are also completely without compassion and indiscriminate in their judgement. They will not hesitate to slaughter a whole city if they have been wronged in some perceived manner, but will not turn their anger to those undeserving of it.
As a result of their torment-riddled history, the mages of Edranor have become extremely xenophobic. Roughly one percent of population will be killed each month in every land owned by Edranor where hostile dominion still holds sway until the local population is fully pacified. The hostile dominion will be reduced at a rate of on average one candle per three months, though it will not automatically turn to friendly on its own. Once there is no more hostile dominion in a province, it will be considered pacified, and the killings will stop."

#descr "The Eolian Highlanders were always known for two things; poverty and enthusiasm for slings. Rich in little apart from rocks, slinging was a popular pastime in Eolia. The Eolians made their slings from not a single thong, but rather of three, strengthened with stitching which provided against the slipping of the bullet. Their slings had a longer reach and a surer aim and it was even said they could hurl their missiles through small rings placed at a considerable distance. Where professional armies with archers and swordsman fell before the undead legions, the Eolians' simple slings triumphed. Now the Eolians use weapons and armor and carry lead bullets forged and smelted by Thirnan smiths."

When the undead legions swept across the lands, and Death was at Eolia's doorstep, all Eolians took up slings to defend their ancestral lands, and defend it they did, for a time. But as the undead legions grew in number, the Eolians were forced to leave their homeland, lest they be overrun. It is at Fenrel that they made their stand against the undead along with the other exiled peoples. It is at Fenrel that the Eolians united with the remnants of other kingdoms and managed in holding Death at bay. Unlike men, the Eolian War Maidens use staff slings. The staff slings can throw heavy projectiles a much greater distance and at a higher arc, and are nearly as accurate as hand slings in practiced hands. The staff itself can also become a close combat weapon in a melee."

Regiments of pikemen frequently form the core battle line of mercenary forces and have proven their effectiveness countless times against all manner of foes, though they are especially useful against an enemy with poor morale or a lack of good armour. Though these regions lack the mass manufacturing of plate armour available to the State Troops of the Empire, they have a good supply of chain mail, much of it passed down through many generations of fractious internal warfare. Such is the ubiquity of pike regiments in Tilea that standard training practices for these troops have become quite advanced and virtually all pikemen are drilled in tight formation fighting and marching long distances."

They typically work in concert with the battle line of Pikemen, whittling down enemy missile troops and providing a threat against heavily armoured foes. The Crossbowmen of Tilea tend to be quite well drilled and accurate with their chosen weapons but are otherwise lightly equipped and unsuited to melee combat."

Almogavars are particularly ferocious infantry that are a common sight on Estalian battlefields; they are men from the hills, barely civilised by the standards of more urbane Estalians, who have made raiding and warfare a way of life. When Estalia was invaded and brought under the control of Araby it was the villages and hamlets controlled by the Almogavars that offered the firmest resistance and these hardy warriors became greatly feared and respected by the foreigners. Now Almogavars can often be found working as mercenaries as far afield as Araby, the Border Princes, and of course Tilea. They are not heavily armoured and fight with relatively simple weapons of a previous era; spears and javelins, but they are physically strong, skilled, brave, and surprisingly well disciplined."

Estalia in particular venerates the art of the fencer and provides a ready supply of trained swordsmen seeking mercenary work. As with pikemen, mercenary swordsmen make use of chain mail rather than the plate mass manufactured for State Troops in the Empire, but they carry shields to afford them with extra protection and tend to wear helms of Estalian design.

Nonetheless there are still many Dwarfs who live in communities beyond the holds, or seek life beyond the confines of their clan. Some of these Dwarfs, especially those in southern realms of men, take up the profession of mercenary and find no shortage of work, for while they can be hard negotiators, Dwarfs are also highly reliable. Mercenary Dwarf Warriors fight in the traditional style of their people with axe and shield and always carry the finest quality arms and armour. They make excellent heavy infantry for holding a line or hacking their way through lesser foes."

Arabyan tribal infantry are daring fighters well practiced with their chosen weapons; compact and powerful bows, flashing curved blades, and small shields with a central spike used both to parry and stab. They wear little in the way of armour, but their dark coloured robes are of excellent quality and are said to incorporate Cathayan silk stolen from unfortunate Arabyan traders."

The Border Princes are known to be even more fractious and politically tumultuous than Tilea, for even the pretty kingdoms that make up the land are constantly changing as different charismatic, powerful, or rich individuals seek to establish their own nation. The warfare of pike and crossbow is less popular here than in Estalia or Tilea and warfare is largely dominated by a slog of massed infantry combat punctuated by decisive heavy cavalry charges. Proximity to the Empire has led the Freelancers to adopt very heavy plate armour and barding similar to those used to the north, though they lack the dwarf smithing that makes Imperial Full Plate so prized. While Freelancers are genuinely excellent heavy cavalry they are notoriously costly as mercenaries and aren't particularly willing to put their necks on the line should the tide of battle turn."

#name "Privateer Captain"
#descr "Privateer Captains are the commanders of pirate crews, usually from the island of Sartosa, that ply their bloody trade around the trade-focused realms of Tilea and Estalia. It is common for such crews to seek employment under a mercenary contract rather than trust to the fortune of extorting or stealing from potentially well guarded merchants, so there are typically several in the employ of the city states of Tilea. Privateer Captains are skilled combatants and competent leaders, as they must be able to defend their position from usurpers within and without their crew, but the main attraction of hiring them is gaining access to their ship to sail armies across the sea."

#name "Estalian Almocaden"
#descr "Estalia is a realm of men to the west of Tilea and is not dissimilar in its fractious nature, extensive use of mercenaries, and the dominance of great rival cities. Almogavars are particularly ferocious infantry that are a common sight on Estalian battlefields; they are men from the hills, barely civilised by the standards of more urbane Estalians, who have made raiding and warfare a way of life. When Estalia was invaded and brought under the control of Araby it was the villages and hamlets controlled by the Almogavars that offered the firmest resistance and these hardy warriors became greatly feared and respected by the foreigners. Now Almogavars can often be found working as mercenaries as far afield as Araby, the Border Princes, and of course Tilea. Almocadens are the leaders of Almogavar groups, always promoted up from the ranks based on experience and merit. They are canny tacticians who specialise in leading small groups on raids and can be recognised by their use of the sword and scaled armour, both rare items in Almogavar society."

#name "Assassin"
#descr "The realms of Tilea, Estalia, and the Border Princes are fractious, ruled over by petty tyrants and merchant princes with little sense of unity with or loyalty to their neighbours; wealth and power are always the great motivators. As such the trade of assassins flourishes in these lands and it is not unheard of for a succession of powerful individuals to be mysteriously slain in a short period of time, before some fortunate figure emerges to reap the benefits of their demise and carve up their former holdings. This assassin is a skilled combatant and makes use of a crossbow, the traditional weapon of Tilea. Assassins are careful to ensure they keep on the good side of smugglers and pirates and will not take up work against the residents of the famed pirate isle of Sartosa; as such they can make use of ships to sail considerable distances."

#name "Estalian Alchemist"
#descr "Estalia is a region not dissimilar to Tilea or the Border Princes in its fractious nature, as various small kingdoms and city states vie for power and trading dominance. It was once almost entirely conquered by the forces of Araby but was subsequently liberated by a grand alliance of Bretonnia, Marienburg, the Empire, and Tilea. A subsequently uneasy peace eventually gave way to enthusiastic trading and the fortunes of Estalia improved as the cities, Magritta in particular, became centres of commerce with an increasingly polyglot population. The Alchemists Guild was born from this melting pot of influences and to this day trains some of the finest Alchemists in the world, rivalling the Gold College of the Empire but providing a far less rigid education. Estalian Alchemists are commonly employed across the southern regions where they are free to practice their arts without the superstitous persecution they might face further north, though they tend to ask quite an exorbitant fee. In addition to their skill at converting magical resources to gold, Alchemists can create and use short lived but effective magical gems of earth and fire to use in combat. They are known for their uses of stange acidic liquids, necessary components of their art, which they can hurl in battle."

#name "Tilean Sorceress"
#descr "Tilea shares many similarities with the lands of the the Empire and of Bretonnia, and its attitude toward users of magic shares aspects of both cultures, as well as influences from Estalia. In Bretonnia magic is strictly the domain of the servants of The Lady and closely tied to the national religion, while in the Empire it is the Colleges of Magic originally established by the High Elf Teclis that restrict and control such power. While Tilea makes use of Alchemists from Estalia and mercenary College Mages from the Empire, the heart of their magical prowess comes from the Society of Sorceresses, a cabal of female magic users of considerable power and influence. Sorceresses do focus their studies like their counterparts in the Empire and will never attempt to master more than one or maybe two Winds of Magic, but universally study astrology, prognostication, and herbology too, for these disciplines are vital in their position as advisors and protectors of the rulers of the cities of Tilea. It is said that the Sorceresses of Tilea were originally taught their art by Elves who did not wish to return to their homeland of Ulthuan and settled in the south of the Old World. Sorceresses are known for their beauty and it said they have discovered some method to retain their youth."

#descr "The members of Ragged Ricco's Republican Guard are amongst the wealthiest and best equipped mercenaries in all of Tilea. Though initially the regiment was formed exclusively of former soldiers serving the new Republic of Remas, as it grew in fame and popularity as a mercenary company it attracted a great number of aspiring applicants, from which Ricco hand picks only those with a sense of justice to match their thirst for wealth and adventure. The Republican Guard is well drilled and comprised of skilled and physically fit soldiers, but their most remarkable feature is their ornate and expensive armour; simultaneously a way of displaying the success of the regiment, keeping a soldier's accumulated wealth close to hand, and offering them superb protection. The Guard fight in tight pike formations and adorn their equipment with blood red scarves to show pride in their battle scars and white scarves to show the favour of the local populace. Under Ricco's leadership they have made a habit of taking on just causes where possible and are equally well practiced at rooting out bandits and protecting besieged holds."

Ricco was hailed as the savior of the Republic and showered with praise, but the city of Remas was left virtually bankrupt and the Guard agreed to become a mercenary regiment and support themselves rather than demanding pay from their beleaguered home. Under Ricco's leadership and with considerable experience in battle the Republican Guard quickly found great success and wealth in the mercenary life and established themselves as a professional and reliable force with a strong sense of justice (for mercenaries at least). Hearing of their exploits the Republic of Remas bid them return, and promptly imprisoned Ricco, demanding the Guard hand over their earnings to the merchant council for 'the good of the city'. The Guard fought their way into and out of the leaning tower of Remas, freeing their leader and vowing to return some day to liberate their home once more. Like his men Ricco wears ornate and expensive armour and is a highly skilled fighter. Such is Ricco's charm and popularity with the common folk that his mere presence decreases unrest.

Although their armour is hopelessly out of date and cheap, it does afford them decent enough protection that they are able to hold the line and they make up for their lower quality with low cost in gold, large size of the regiment, and belief in their cause.

He realised that for all his suffering, it was truly the farmers and peasants who got the worst of the constant battles in Tilea, so he pledged to do something about it. Rodrigo took what small wealth he had left, bought a supply of antiquated but still functional armour and second hand pikes from a trader, rallied a group of former labourers left homeless by the war, and founded the Alcatani Fellowship.

Though all members of the tribe grew stronger from this blessing, only the most powerful champions of Urslo are fully Bearstruck and transform into werebears. Beorg is the latest Chieftain of Urslo and the most potently blessed in generations, for he is permanently transformed into a towering amalgam of man and bear. When a great Chaos incursion swept south he and his men joined to raid and bring glory to Urslo, but the incursion scattered over time and Beorg's group found themselves hunted in hostile lands. Hearing of an opportunity for coin and battle they headed south and became a mercenary regiment, finding it easy to stand out amongst the weak men of the civilised lands. Beorg is a terrible force on the battlefield, rending the enemy to pieces with his claws and fangs while protected by both chain mail armour and the ward provided by the magical Bear Fang Talisman passed to him by the elders of Urslo.

Filled with a drunken rage he managed to pin the creature and struck in its skull with his bare hands, much to his own amazement. Wu Song went on to develop a martial art focused on unarmed strikes and the tempering of the body using internal energies unlocked by the drinking of potent alcohol. Travelling west he so impressed a group of bandits that they swore to follow him to the ends of the earth and enthusiastically took up his practice of drinking before combat, though they lack the patience to truly learn his art.

While the Necromancer was initially successful he was eventually driven back to his lair in the forest and, calculating that the winds had shifted, Richter waited for an opportune moment and ran his employer through with his sword.

Sometimes the undead would persist beyond the length of a battle and do in this way Richter formed his new Cursed Company that now seeks mercenary work across the world.

Most of these newly raised undead cannot sustain their unholy vigour past the end of the battle and crumble away to dust, but some join the regiment. They are mindless puppets that serve as Richter's mercenary regiment purely to continue his curse to seek constant battle and death as the leader of a mercenary force. Each carries a shield bearing the marking of the Cursed Company. Unlike other skeletal warriors the Cursed Companions are still acting out the pantomime of being mercenaries and as such require payment in gold, though it is not known what they or Richter do with it. The power of the curse is such that these undead are tougher and harder to banish than usual."

Like many inhabitants of the only remaining harbor hold in Dwarfdom, Drong felt a call to the sea in his blood and joined the navy, eventually working his way up to the Captaincy of a large trading vessel dedicated to the hauling of ale. Tasked with a special mission to deliver a selection of incredibly rare ale for a royal wedding in a distant hold, the ship was caught in a sudden and massive storm near the isle of Sartosa. Both ship and cargo were lost, but miraculously Drong and nearly a third of is crew survived, washed up on the beach of the isle. The shame of this loss was too great to bear and they all swore the Slayer Oath on the spot, before heading inland and quickly taking over both the stronghold and ship of the pirate Capitano Sisicco. From their base in Sartosa the Slayer Pirates struck out to fulfil their vows (and fill their pockets) and made a reputation for themselves recovering treasure chests lost to monsters or other fearsome enemies. As the reputation of Long Drong's Slayer Pirates grew they were joined by other shamed seafaring Dwarfs and they are now one of the most famous mercenary regiments. Drong is a fearsome slayer instantly recognisable for his hook hand, peg leg, and the tropical bird always perched on his shoulder. Unlike other Slayers who activate their magical tattoos only in battle, Long Drong and his Slayers keep theirs constantly active through communal drinking of incredibly potent grog and singing of sea shanties.

Voland himself is a capable commander and warrior, though his interests often lie in gold, feasting, and women rather than glory in battle.

#name "Birdman of Catrazza"
#descr "The Birdmen of Catrazza are a bizarre mercenary regiment propelled to great heights both literal and figurative by an invention of the great genius Leonardo da Miragliano adapted by the lesser genius Daddallo of Verezzo. Equipped with a mechanical winged harness they are able to take to the skies for limited periods and this has proven a highly marketable talent in such a fortified and fractious land as Tilea. The Birdmen initially experimented with melee weapons, diving down with sword or lance, but being lightly armoured, necessarily slight of build, and encumbered by the harness, they soon abandoned this tactic in favour of the classic Tilean crossbow. They are usually employed as a rapid response force or hired to help besiege a particularly troublesome fortification. They are known for their bravery and their pride in their unusual talents and monicker as 'Birdmen', which they flaunt by wearing ornate beaked masks. In their line of work the Birdmen often find themselves the targets of ranged weapons and since shields and heavy armour are too heavy, they've come up with various ingenious tricks using their wings and powerful buffets of air to protect themselves from incoming fire."

When the expedition landed and immediately ran into a series of problems Pirazzo had repeatedly warned them of in advance, including the ships they came on abandoning them with the paychests, it didn't take long for the mercenaries to realise Pirazzo was their best hope and quickly dispatch of their former leaders. The young captain whipped the force into shape, separating them into well coordinated crossbow and pike formations, and driving the bad elements out of the camp to perish in the jungle. Setting off into the interior of the continent Pirazzo's men at first battled with the native lizard people and performed well, showing the Skinks and Saurus the power of their disciplined formations, but a strange accord was finally met between Pirazzo and a Skink Priest and the Estalians were granted unusual gold tablets in exchange for marching south to a new coastline. Here they battled vampires and a throng of zombie pirates, realising that the Skink Priest had effectively hired them as mercenaries. Stealing a half rotted pirate ship the remaining forces managed to make it back to Tobaro and Pirazzo used his Lustrian gold to form an entirely novel mercenary regiment trained to use both pike and crossbow, switching between them at a moment's notice. His fame spread as a man who returned from doom and Pirazzo's 'Lost Legion' as they were known became highly sought after.

The young captain whipped the force into shape, separating them into well coordinated crossbow and pike formations, and driving the bad elements out of the camp to perish in the jungle. Setting off into the interior of the continent Pirazzo's men at first battled with the native lizard people and performed well, showing the Skinks and Saurus the power of their disciplined formations, but a strange accord was finally met between Pirazzo and a Skink Priest and the Estalians were granted unusual gold tablets in exchange for marching south to a new coastline. Here they battled vampires and a throng of zombie pirates, realising that the Skink Priest had effectively hired them as mercenaries. Stealing a half rotted pirate ship the remaining forces managed to make it back to Tobaro and Pirazzo used his Lustrian gold to form an entirely novel mercenary regiment trained to use both pike and crossbow, switching between them at a moment's notice. His fame spread as a man who returned from doom and Pirazzo's 'Lost Legion' as they were known became highly sought after.

These cloaks are enchanted by the forbidden magic used by Malkus to grant them considerable protection against mundane weapons and render the Manflayers harder to detect. Both of these attributes lend themselves well to the primary task of the regiment; to raid, plunder, and sow terror in enemy lands. Each Corsair is armed with a pair of wicked serrated blades and wears light armour which still allows them to swim should they need to. Like all Dark Elf Corsairs they are skilled fighters and there are few in the Old World that can match them."

#descr "Halflings are a race of diminutive humanoids that primarily dwell in the province of the Empire known as the Moot, though they can be found across the Old World and sometimes beyond. Small and plump, with a fondness for food and drink, they are not natural fighters but are excellent woodsmen and are extremely resistant to hostile magic. The Halfling Rangers that make up the regiment known as the Fighting Cocks take the Halfling affinity for nature, hunting, and stealth to quite an extreme and additionally have an unusual fondness for warfare, particularly when they can ambush the enemy or simply pepper them from long range while others take most of the risk. They are excellent marksmen though will struggle to damage well armoured enemies. The Cocks take their name from the bright red plumes they wear atop their hats and their crowing victory calls as their enemies flee."

Eventually Croop's group reached Tilea and did indeed find both wealth and adventure as the regiment known as Lumpin Croop's Fighting Cocks, for there is great demand for such skilled woodsmen and archers at affordable rates.

#descr "The Ogres that make up Golgfag's regiment are hardened mercenaries who recognise that they're probably better off being on the side of their hulking Captain than standing against him on the field of battle. Ogres are well known for taking up work as mercenaries, particularly those who have headed east or west from the Ogre Kingdoms of the Mountains of Mourn and run into the realms of Men, Greenskins, and Dwarfs. Should they become particularly successful they will usually choose to split off and either return to their homeland to seek power there or try their hand at even more lucrative opportunities, but Golgfag's reputation ensures that his Ogres tend to stay for longer than usual. Golgfag's mercenaries are inevitably well armed and armoured and are among the most effective shock troops available in Tilea."

#descr "The man now known as the fearless Al Muktar, commander of the Desert Dogs, was once a Marienburg merchant's son named Werner Glook. Werner was a slight and rather timid youth subject to much bullying from his family and peers, who escaped the casual cruelty of his life by dreaming of adventures in exotic lands. He dedicated himself to learning the language of distant Araby and, when his father finally drank himself into to the grave, swiftly left for their exotic land. Once there rumours of a golden haired foreigner able to speak near perfect Arabyan spread and people whispered that this might perhaps be Al Muktar, the Fated One, whose arrival had been predicted by astrologers earlier that year. When his trade caravan was attacked by nomad raiders and unwilling to let his dream die, Werner fought like a man possessed, badly injuring several raiders before being subdued. The nomads were aggravated by his actions and decided to stake the foreigner out in the desert sun to die slowly, but somehow Werner clung to life for several days and in his delirium began to cry out an unfamiliar phrase he had heard whispered by strangers in his presence; 'Al Muktar'. The nomads, fearful that this strange figure might indeed be the Fated One, freed the foreigner and took him into their number. Within a few years Al Muktar, for that is who the man had become, or perhaps always been, had become their leader and brought them to fight as a mercenary company in the lands of Estalia and Tilea. Al Muktar rides upon the same fine Arabyan steed as his men and is armed in the same manner, having become a highly skilled warrior known for his boundless tenacity and bravery. Even people of other faiths can recognise that Al Muktar clearly has some divinely ordained destiny and he is considered sacred.

#descr "Far to the east of the Old World, beyond the Dark Lands, beyond even the Ogre Kingdoms, lie the seemingly endless plains of the great steppe. It is here that the nomadic hobgoblins rule, thousands of tribes of wolf riding warriors led by lesser Khans, all in service of the Great Hobgobla Khan. Oglah was once amongst the most celebrated Khans to serve the Great Khan directly, controlling a substantial force of wolf riders and even giving orders to weaker Khans during his master's many campaigns. Called to reinforce a great host in the process of being destroyed by a massive army from Cathay, Oglah saw which way the wind was blowing and immediately switched sides, favouring Cathayan silver over potential death. This was fairly typical behaviour for a hobgoblin, but the Great Khan demanded greater loyalty from his inner circle and Oglah soon found his tribe pursued and harried almost to extinction by the Great Khan's forces. Fleeing his homeland and crossing the Dark Lands, the battle tested Khan and his wolf riders quickly took to mercenary life in the Old World. Oglah still receives reinforcements from hobgoblins who escape the lands of the Chaos Dwarfs or flee the steppe and his regiment, the Wolfboyz, have gained fame as a highly effective, if untrustworthy, force of cavalry archers.

Oglah has little patience for weakness or the typical backstabbing and cowardice of the hobgoblins found in the Dark Lands and emphasises a more pack-like mentality for his warriors. Consequently the Wolfboyz have quite a bit more fight to them than one might expect, though at the end of the day they are still hobgoblins. Thy fight in the traditional manner from wolf-back with bow and lance and wear the unusual blue scale armour favoured on the Great Steppe."

The men of the Vendetta are expected to accept that each mission may be their last and to live life on the edge, flirting with death and living by the sword, just like their leader. These duelists are talented combatants and extensively train in a style which allows them to handle multiple foes at once, but their individualistic nature and the improvisational quality of their fighting art means they are not well suited to formation fighting. In addition to their twin blades they are known to line their capes with a metal mesh and use them as shields and typically carry a small supply of throwing daggers."

#descr "The men of Morgan Bernhardt's Grudgebringer Cavalry are seasoned mercenaries who have fought across much of the Old World and seen their fortunes rise and fall many times. Rather than acting as noble heavy shock cavalry armed with lances as are popular in the Empire and Bretonnia, the Grudgebringers are medium cavalry that fight with swords and do not use barding, favouring flexibility and manoeuvrability. Still they are well armed with excellent training and Morgan's fame as a fair and just leader is such that they never lack for reinforcements."

Morgan was born to a merchant family in Nuln and sent to the officer school attached to the famed Nuln Armory. Here his natural talents and intelligence proved insufficient to counter his recklessness and insubordination, leading to a swift expulsion and blacklisting from a career in the formal military. Lacking the background to secure a place in the nobleborn cavalry of a knightly order, Morgan was adrift, unable to use his training or talents. Fate smiled on the young man, as while drowning his sorrows in a tavern he got into an argument with a group of mercenaries which culminated in the first of the inspiring speeches for which he would later be famed. Hearing the bold speech several of the younger mercenaries agreed to join Morgan to prove themselves better than their elders and an elderly wizard of the Bright College, seeing a fire in Morgan's eyes, gifted him a magical blade named Grudgebringer. So began an illustrious mercenary career which would take Morgan all across the Old World and see him gain the favour of figures such as the Emperor Karl Franz, the Reiksmarshall Kurt Helborg, and King Louen Leoncoeur of Bretonnia. Morgan is a wildly talented commander who balances experience and training with inspiring speeches and acts of reckless valour, enabled by his skill with the blade Grudgebringer, whose name and likeness his regiment took up as a lucky charm.

The smallest and weakest of this tribe are easily the size of one of the common giants of the Old World and are often commanded by the Druids that rule Albion, used as bodyguards, labourers, and warriors. The Giants of Albion are perhaps a little smarter than those on the continent, though surely still slow witted, and have learned to hurl boulders at their foe before charging in stomping and swinging their massive clubs.

Unfortunately this angered the merchants of Remas and they placed a harsh embargo on transporting the Druid and his giants home, and so Hengus has taken up mercenary work in order to make ends meet until he can find a way home. The Druid himself is a capable spellcaster, but his true power comes from his bodyguards; towering giants of Albion capable of hurling boulders great distances and smashing entire regiments with their clubs.

Known as a highly skilled general with a particular talent for commanding siege warfare, Borgio is also an astute politician with the paranoid streak more or less required to survive as a leader in a land where loyalty often lives on the edge of a coin and assassins are common. Despite all of his precautions the Prince of Miragliano has found himself the victim of many plots but has so far survived being stabbed, poisoned, caught in a massive fire, and supposedly even magically electrocuted in his own bath; these incidents have added to his reputation as a man who simply cannot be killed. In combat Borgio carries the best wargear afforded to someone of his wealth and power; the Monstrous Helm which strikes fear into his enemies, magical Brazen Armour capable of deflecting almost any blow, and the Mace of Might which grants him incredible strength."

#descr "Leonardo da Miragliano came from humble and obscure origins in the winding streets of the city from which he takes his name. His genius was first noticed at a young age when he was assigned as a messenger boy to a prominent architect employed by the Merchant Prince Cosimo, as the precocious youth saw fit to make changes to plans he was tasked with taking to the Prince. Cosimo, known for having an excellent eye for talent and an impressive mind of his own, quickly realised who had made the astoundingly innovative changes to the plans and immediately took Leonardo under his care. Little did Cosimo realise just how significant a discovery this was, for Leonardo has perhaps the greatest mind known to man, tempered only by his frustratingly short attention span: as an inventor, artist, and designer he rarely sticks with any project for long before becoming obsessed with solving a totally unrelated and seemingly impossible problem. A true polymath, Leonardo seems to be capable of effortlessly mastering any craft, art, or science in a distressingly short period of time, but he is perhaps best known for his occasional forays into military design; indeed it was Leonardo who in a matter of days drew up plans for the Steam Tank eventually built by the Engineers Guild of the Empire. Many Princes have sought the Master Inventor's help in either erecting impregnable siege defences, or designing the means to breach such defences, and Leonardo is quite practiced at either side of siege warfare, as well as methods to more quickly arm military forces. On the eve of battle he is known to quickly scribble down a series of equations and suggest adjustments to the ranged weapons of his patron's forces, greatly improving their accuracy.

He is a controversial figure, lauded by some as a great general who might restore the glory of Ancient Tilea, and by others as a delusional thug clothing himself in the aesthetics of a lost time. From his youth Lorenzo has always been obsessed with the glory and splendour of the bygone age of his ancestors, when Tilea stood as an emerging power that led in military, artistic, and scholarly matters and, in his view, traded with the Elves of Ulthuan as equals. The ruler of Luccini lives in a palazzo decorated in the antique style, rejects many modern trappings, and even arms himself in the style of his forefathers. It was Lorenzo who reinstituted the athletic persuits of his ancestors and in many sports such as wrestling, rowing, and hurling of the discus, Lorenzo is a current or former champion, for the man is a towering figure of muscle like a living statue. Lorenzo has led many campaigns to retrieve the lost artifacts of his ancestors and now holds the deadly Sword of Lucan, the dazzling Shield of Myrmidia, and the inspiring Ring of Luccina. While many find the man faintly ridiculous or outright delusional, there is no doubting his military success or his popularity amongst his own troops. Because Lucan carries the Shield of Myrmidia he is sacred to the followers of the Goddess and to Tileans generally, as a people who prefer to hedge their bets when it comes to divinity."

#name "Doomed Slayer"
#descr "Gotrek Gurnisson is perhaps the most famous Dwarf Slayer alive, which is ironic because he is in many ways an abject failure as a Slayer. At all turns Gotrek has failed to find a glorious death in battle; no matter how far he travels and how deadly a foe he faces, he always prevails, usually because he is a nearly unmatched killing machine. Gotrek wields a staggeringly powerful starmetal axe known as the Runemaster's Axe, recovered early in his Slayer career from the ruins of the fallen hold of Karak Dum; truly one of the greatest artifacts of the Dwarf golden age. In the Slayer's hands it has put an end to trolls, giants, vampires, beasts, and even a Greater Daemon of Chaos. Already a terrifying and near unstoppable force of destruction before he met the human agitator and adventurer Felix Jaeger, since that foolish warrior-poet swore a drunken blood oath to witness and write of his glorious death, Gotrek only seems to be more favoured, or perhaps cursed, by fate to overcome any foe."

#name "Warrior Poet"
#descr "Felix Jaeger is best known as the constant, if initially unwilling, companion of the legendary Dwarf Slayer Gotrek Gurnisson. Felix was born to wealthy merchants who sought entry into the ranks of the aristocracy of the Empire and so sent their son to study at the University of Altdorf and become an officer in the Imperial army. Felix, always something of a rebel, decided to take up poetry, drinking, and duelling instead, and his academic life ended when he accidentally killed a fellow student in a drunken duel. Expelled and disowned, Felix found himself amongst the common people and joined their cause in protesting the oppressive Window Tax in Altdorf, getting swept up in riots and nearly killed by a charge from mounted Reiksguard. His life was saved that day by Gotrek and Felix drunkenly swore a blood oath that he would witness and write of the Slayer's glorious death. He accompanies Gotrek to this day, though in his epic battle with a Greater Daemon the Slayer did technically die (if only temporarily) and the oath was released, so the two are no longer forced to spend every moment together. Felix was already a decent duellist and constant years of travel, adventure, and peril with Gotrek have sharpened his skills considerably, especially with a runeblade he found along the way, though he is of course nowhere near a match for the Slayer in the business of sheer destruction. Some of Gotrek's fate to survive no matter the odds has certainly rubbed off on Felix and he effectively bears the mark of Drengi like his companion."

Each of the eight Winds of Magic is represented by its own College and the mages of those Colleges are known by the common name for their respective wind, such as the Bright Wizards who use the fiery wind of Aqshy. This contract will supply you with a random mage from one of the eight Colleges: Amber, Amethyst, Bright, Celestial, Gold, Grey, Jade, and Light. Hiring mages in this way is rather expensive, but allows Tilea access to considerable magical diversity.

Amethyst Wizards are a potent force on the battlefield, capable of snuffing out life, undoing their foes and even animating the dead if the cause is severe enough to risk the wrath of the Sigmarites. The Amethyst College is a dark and crooked structure overlooking the reputedly haunted great plague cemetery of Altdorf."

The wind of Hysh is the purest amongst the Lores, though it is also the most effusive and difficult to master. Because of this, Light Wizards tend to work together in complex rituals and communions to stand the best chance of casting their spells. Light magic can heal and protect, but also sear and consume, particularly against unnatural enemies. The pyramidal Light College lies at a mystic conjunction of power lines and taps into the energies of Hysh with an elaborate system of mirrors and prisms. Deep beneath the College, the Vault of Light, created by Teclis himself, serves as a prison for the most powerful, and corrupt, artifacts of Chaos."

#name "Nehekharan Warrior"
#descr "In addition to the massive armies of regular soldiers that could be mustered in ancient Nehekhara there were many individual brotherhoods of warriors who swore loyalty to particular cities, Kings, branches of nobility, or even monuments to the gods. These warriors did not return to agricultural labour during the farming season, or assist in the construction of great works, but instead trained and fought year round and were known for their skill on the battlefield. Just as in their former lives, they are sought after additions to the army of any Tomb King. Like any other common undead of Nehekhara they were not buried with any particular ritual or preservation but are not mindless and are hard to banish. Nehekharan Warriors favour the use of two light blades and forgo the traditional shield, relying on a more offensive style of fighting.

Being highly favoured by their King and entombed within royal Tomb pyramids, the now risen Tomb Guard benefit from burial rituals far more sophisticated than those afforded to their lessers; in addition to preserving more of their memories in undeath, this lends them a supernatural toughness and resistance to hostile magic. The traditional weapon of the Tomb Guard is the khopesh, a curved hacking weapon peculiar to and perfected by ancient Nehekhara. The weapons of the Tomb Guard are imbued with powerful incantations by the Mortuary Cult and have only grown more deadly over thousands of years in the Tomb.

Ptra created the human race in his image and elevated the Nehekharans above all others, blessing them with his wisdom, glory, and the promise of an afterlife by his side for those who made the proper offerings. Each of the gods were served by their own priests and some had armed followers dedicated to keeping their sacred sites safe, but only the sacred warriors of Asaph and Ptra were forces powerful enough to rival the armies of Tomb Kings. The Guardians of Ptra carried spears blessed with the Great Father's burning wrath capable of searing unholy creatures from existence; they acted as a vital vanguard in the battles which saw Nagash defeated in the first great war against the necromancer. Though Ptra is now greatly diminished from the time of ancient Nehekhara his Guardians may still be raised to battle in his name at the command of the Tomb Kings. Being blessed by Ptra they are surrounded by a blinding light when they battle under the sun, for the Great Father's gaze falls kindly upon them still.

Stalkers are instinctively able to hunt down and ambush trespassers and are extremely quick, making them excellent patrollers, well feared by any who would dare tread the land of Nehekhara seeking to find treasure in the many ruins. The rituals that animate the Stalkers are complex and grant them both great resilience and a gaze capable of turning the flesh of mortals to marble. Even if the unfortunate target of the Stalker's gaze is not entirely changed to stone, they may well suffer terrible injuries as parts of them crumble into sand.

They are sculpted by Necrotects in the form of Usirian's great scorpion companions which guard the gate to the Underworld and each Scorpion also acts as a sarcophagus in which the remains of a fallen Liche High Priest are interred. Though the Liche High Priest has been destroyed, the vestiges of his spirit power and protect the mighty Scorpion and his residual desire for vengeance motivates its slaughter of the enemy. Tomb Scorpions, as animated sarcophagi for powerful members of the Mortuary Cult, are sacred.

No expense was spared in their construction and their forms are lavished with gold and jewels. In one hand the Hierotitan carries an ornate staff bearing the hieroglyph of the Sun God Ptra, to light the way through the abyss that separates the mortal world from the afterlife and ward away the Daemons that sometimes prowl there. The Hierotitan's other hand carries the scales on which the soul of the King shall be judged by Usirian the God of the Underworld. Both of these items are potent magical artifacts, with the scales capable of unleashing holy judgement upon the foe and the staff able to emit beams of light that spare the servants of Nehekhara while scouring the enemy from existence. Within each Hierotitan is the mummified form of a great High Priest from the Mortuary Cult who died before the discovery of the secrets that allowed them to cheat death; it is this form which animates the Hierotitan and gives them their holy purpose. Such is the power of the Hierotitan that it spreads the dominion of Nehekhara with its presence and increases the winds of magic wherever it treads.

#descr "Necropolis Knights are members of the Tomb Guard who ride atop giant snake-shaped statues known as Necroserpents. Necroserpents were originally sculpted to guard the entranceways to the temples of the Mortuary Cult, many of them taking the guise of the infamous hooded Khemrian cobra, though with embellishments of skulls and other death imgaery. The venom of the Khemrian cobra was legendary, able to cause total paralysis within a matter of seconds, and the fangs of the Necroserpents mysteriously drip with the same substance. At the foot of each Necroserpent statue lay a small tomb containing the remains of one who, despite years of honourable service in the elite forces of his King, felt he had become in some way dishonoured and had sacrificed his life to the Cobra god Qu'aph, whose venom can cleanse any sin. With the rise of the Tomb Kings and undead Nehekhara the souls of these fallen soldiers were bound to the statues and they awoke as one, powerful knights in service of their King once again. Should the Knight be struck down the Necroserpent will fight on and if victorious the remains of the rider will reassemble to ride atop his bonded mount once more.

They once lived in the mountains to the east of Nehekhara and would descend to feast on the slain and wounded in the wake of great battles; no commoner dared raise a hand against them for they were sacred beasts, agents of Ualatp, who bore the spirits of lost warriors to the sky to battle Daemons in an unending war. Some Kings sought to seize the favour of Ualatp and his warrior hosts in the afterlife and so had Carrion embalmed and entombed alongside them by the thousands. When the Tomb Kings arose so too did the Carrion and now they prowl Nehekhara once more and are often bound to the will of Liche Priests in service of a King. Unlike most Nehekharan undead Carrion are known to disobey the bidding of their master and flee battle at times, for they retain their animalistic sense of self preservation. As agents of Ualatp even in death the Carrion are sacred.

Most of these scuttling creatures are resigned to the duty of cleaning up the remains of interlopers to the Tomb Kings' realm, but the reanimated corpse of the Khepra Scorpion, a particularly large and aggressive variety found only in Nehekhara, is often used in battle to overwhelm or distract enemy troops. Though these creatures are dangerous pests alone, in sufficient numbers they become a terrifying tide of chitinous death rolling over the desert, swarming over and stinging to death anything that lives."

Only in service to Khemri, though, would the Mortuary Cult animate these massive statues to wage war, tearing through the enemy ranks with a howdah of elite soldiers on their back. With the rise of the Tomb Kings the Warsphinxes are once more being awakened, now crewed by Tomb Guard, to once more devastate the enemies of Nehekhara. Warsphinxes are incredibly hardly, nearly industructible by normal means, and are capable of breathing gouts of fire said to be drawn from the endless funeral pyres of the unworthy dead.

Unfortunately this very network of operatives was one of the first places Nagash was able to corrupt and use to increase his power and it was not allowed to survive the first overthrow of the foul Necromancer. After the fall of Nehekhara and the rise of the Tomb Kings, such clandestine operations remained out of the question, and when a scout is needed a skeletal Horseman is enchanted with somewhat expensive inscriptions of stealth and misdirection before being sent to watch for enemy activity.

In battle they wore ceremonial armour and bore an icon of their master at all times while wearing a golden mask in the likeness of their ruler. Upon the death of the King or Prince the Herald was ritually sacrificed and placed guard at the entrance to their Tomb chamber. Though Heralds were not mummified the rituals preserving them and proximity to their ruler have granted them considerable physical strength and magical resistance, in addition to almost fully preserving the memories of their former life. Heralds, as representatives of members of a royal dynasty, have considerable martial authority and are considered sacred, though they cannot command the magically animated constructs of Nehekhara.

#descr "The Priest Kings of ancient Nehekhara ruled the city states that made up that empire, exercising absolute authority in all matters martial, spiritual, and philosophical. So great was their power that they sought to hold dominion over death itself and would have their priests perform rituals to prolong their life, though they also made incredibly elaborate preparations for their entry into the afterlife. Once Settra, greatest of the Kings and the first to unify Nehekhara, established the precedent of building a massive Royal Tomb, the lesser Kings that followed did the same, focusing more and more on the glorious afterlife that awaited them than matters of state. When Nagash cast the Great Ritual, raising every soul in Nehekhara as his puppet, the Kings rose from their tombs, and when he fell at the hand of the sole living survivor of Nehekhara, their minds were fully restored to them. After a period of terrible chaos in which dozens of Kings who held unquestioned authority in different eras vyed for control of what they saw as theirs, Settra returned and established a new era in which the Tomb Kings would take turns ruling the ruined cities of undead Nehekhara or lying dormant in their Royal Tombs. A Tomb King is a powerful being indeed, preserved through sophisticated rites of mummification, protected by powerful wards, and granted unnatural strength. They go to battle on foot or atop great war chariots and wield deadly Eternal Blades, entombed with them that they might travel unchallenged through the underworld. Any who strike the King may suffer the wrath of the Gods that bless them and be cursed should they manage to fell them. So great are the wards of preservation placed on them that within the dominion of Nehekhara Tomb Kings are practically immortal, able to reform their bodies in the Valley of Tombs should they be defeated.

#name "Tomb King"
#descr "The Priest Kings of ancient Nehekhara ruled the city states that made up that empire, exercising absolute authority in all matters martial, spiritual, and philosophical. So great was their power that they sought to hold dominion over death itself and would have their priests perform rituals to prolong their life, though they also made incredibly elaborate preparations for their entry into the afterlife. Once Settra, greatest of the Kings and the first to unify Nehekhara, established the precedent of building a massive Royal Tomb, the lesser Kings that followed did the same, focusing more and more on the glorious afterlife that awaited them than matters of state. When Nagash cast the Great Ritual, raising every soul in Nehekhara as his puppet, the Kings rose from their tombs, and when he fell at the hand of the sole living survivor of Nehekhara, their minds were fully restored to them. After a period of terrible chaos in which dozens of Kings who held unquestioned authority in different eras vyed for control of what they saw as theirs, Settra returned and established a new era in which the Tomb Kings would take turns ruling the ruined cities of undead Nehekhara or lying dormant in their Royal Tombs. A Tomb King is a powerful being indeed, preserved through sophisticated rites of mummification, protected by powerful wards, and granted unnatural strength. They go to battle on foot or atop great war chariots and wield deadly Eternal Blades, entombed with them that they might travel unchallenged through the underworld. Any who strike the King may suffer the wrath of the Gods that bless them and be cursed should they manage to fell them. So great are the wards of preservation placed on them that within the dominion of Nehekhara Tomb Kings are practically immortal, able to reform their bodies in the Valley of Tombs should they be defeated.

Acolytes are the most numerous and lowest status members of the Priesthood of the Mortuary Cult and were responsible for the majority of day to day observances and burial rites in ancient Nehekhara. They are not particularly magically powerful and have little priestly authority, but without their constant work the Tomb Kings would see Nehekhara slowly fall silent and motionless for good.

#descr "In life Necrotects were the artisans and engineers that designed and oversaw the construction of the great monuments, pyraminds, and Royal Tombs of ancient Nehekhara, as well as the countless statues that could be called to war. Theirs was a highly demanding profession that carried great prestige and those with talent were highly sought after by competing members of the Mortuary Cult, dynastic Royals and even the most powerful Priest Kings. Upon their death they were inevitably granted expensive burial rites and mummification and entombed alongside their masters that they might continue to serve in the glorious afterlife. Their status has only risen since Nehekhara's fall and rise once more as a land of undeath ruled by the Tomb Kings, for the Necrotects are repositories of knowledge from their respective eras that would otherwise be totally lost, and their importance is further highlighted by the fact their works still dominate the Nehekharan landscape. While in life the Necrotects had no magical power in death they are blessed with a new connection to the arcana of sand, stone, death, and shadow. In battle they constantly chant mantras with the power to heal damage dealt to the animated statues of Nehekhara.

#descr "Apophas was an ambitious and jealous prince of Numas who covted the throne of that city. To this end he drugged and slit the throats of the entire royal line, declaring himself King. He proved a ruthless but unpopular ruler and lost the support of the Mortuary Cult, leaving him vulberable to a rebellion which saw him dragged to the temple for judgement. His punishment was severe: to be devoured by scarab beetles such that he would never reach the glorious afterlife. All that was left of Apophas was his skull, which was marked with cursed glyphs and cast into the desert. Apophas' soul was claimed by Usirian, God of the Underworld, but Apophas struck a bargain with the deity: he would return to the world and find a soul even more ruthless and ambitious than his own to replace him in the Underworld. Usirian agreed, but returned Apophas to the mortal realms in the guise of a writhing swarm of scarab beetles, armed with a blade that can reap souls. Usirian now seeks out the most powerful and dangerous foes that he might finally find a soul to match his own and be freed from his eternal servitude. Should Apophas be struck down within the dominion of Nehehkhara he will swiftly return to undeath, indeed he has been known at times to disperse and reform within seconds.

He is the oldest and wisest of the Liche Priests, said to be the very first of their number to successfully stave of death. Following Nagash's Great Ritual which killed the entire population of Nehekhara and then animated and bound every last one of the dead, entombed or otherwise, to his will, Khatep and his followers waited for their moment to take action. Nagash, felled at the height of his power by the sole living human in Nehekhara, lost control of the Tomb Kings and the proud monarchs, free willed once more and full of wrath, each sought to reign their former realms supreme. So began a great and terrible civil war of the dead. It was Khatep who took decisive action; he broke the seals of the Tomb of Settra, the only such structure to have resisted the power of the Great Ritual, and personally awoke the greatest of the Nehehkharan Kings. Settra quickly restored a new order to Nehekhara, but turned on Khatep with a great and terrible fury, for he had been promised an eternal glorious afterlife in paradise, not rulership of a fallen land of undeath. Khatep was banished to the desert, only to return when Nehehkhara could be restored to the promised paradise. With the coming of the War of Ascension, Khatep has returned to serve the Tomb Kings, and Settra, once more.

Ramhotep was the mind behind the Necropolis of Rasetra, the Monoliths of the Great Plains, the Monuments of Eternal Death and many other wonders of Nehekhara. His own tomb, the Sepulchre of the Heavens built in Quatar, was nearly the rival of the Grand Pyramid of Khemri in some ways, though far smaller in scale. With the fall and rise of Nehekhara Ramhotep was awoken to find not only the promised paradise, but a world in which many of his great works had been lost or terrible damaged, horriying the Necrotect Visionary. As he was driven in life to create greater and greater wonders, he is now driven in death to obsessively recover, restore, and protect his legacy and wreak vengeance upon those who have looted and defiled his works of art. Ramhotep's desire for vengeance is such that he enters each battle filled with hateful vigour drawn from the earth to which so many of his works were consigned.

Allowing oneself to be deployed at the front and take the brunt of the fighting comes with many monetary benefits and even the guarantee of being absolved of past crimes, yet not many are foolhardy enough to take up this hazardous task."

They form the first line of Loringia's landsknecht formations and are meant to take the brunt of the fighting. Their name derives from being paid almost twice as much as normal mercenaries. Their arquebuses are slow firing weapons that lack the accuracy of crossbows, but impact their targets with such tremendous force that it ignores both shields and air magic which offers protection from conventional projectiles."

Reiters fight as medium cavalry clad in plate armor and equipped with a broad sword and around half a dozen pistols. Unlike the knights of old they do not require much training to use their weaponry efficiently. Their pistols allow them to harrass infantry without getting into the reach of their polearms as well as adding much needed impact to the charge that follows."

These mages of great renown practice their craft in the Halls of Gnipahellir or their own smaller holds, and are adept magicians and masters of forging.

Like all members of their race, mastersmiths can take the shape of great serpentine beasts if they are threatened but their magical skills are greatly diminished in this form. Competition amongst mastersmiths is fierce and it is not unheard of for particularly ruthless Niblung to pay and equip adventurers to steal from their competitors."

#descr "Antikythera is an empire centered around a great city built upon ancient secrets and mysteries. In a remarkably short time, the empire of metal and steam has become a power to be reckoned with. Strange metallic monstrosities dominate the battlefield while men of iron take to the sky. In recent years Antikytherans have denounced all gods and the only thing they worship now is technology and progress itself. Alchemists and Technomancers relentlessly search for ways to bind man and technology together and rumors speak of attempts to create God."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Heavy infantry, hybrid troops of flesh and metal, automatons and superior weapons.
Magic: Earth, Air, Fire, Astral
Priests: Moderate.
Forts: Each month Antikytheran fortified provinces have a 10% chance per friendly dominion point to increase resources permanently by an amount equal to the present Production scales."

#descr "Descendants of otherworldly angels, the Archons are semi-angelic beings themselves. They preach strong moral values and virtues, and fiercely fight for life, order, and good. Their weapons strike with the power of the Life and Righteousness, and are as such capable of burning undead and demonic beings to cinder. Archons fight for just causes, and preach virtue and obedience to their subjects. They seldom seek to overrun any kingdom, but instead seem to appear where they might most likely be overpowered. Still, they persevere and are fearless in the face of death.
Archons appear as tall, sturdy, humanoids with striking features and a radiant aura that has led many to tremble before them. They are particularly powerful against the Undead."
#summary "Race: Humanoids.
Military: Infantry, archers, cavalry, fliers, powerful sacreds and anti-undead troops.
Magic: Astral, Fire, Air and Water. Saints can boost their magic powers through a death-shape.
Priests: Powerful. Can convert conquered temples instead of demolishing them.
All national commanders have prophet shapes with different minor bonuses."
#brief "The realm of tall, sturdy humanoids with striking features and a radiant aura. Archons are long lived and generally and more physically and mentally fit then humans. They also poses strong anti-demon and anti-undead capabilities."

#name "Hollowmoor"
#epithet "The Cursed Prison"
#era 2
#descr "Long ago a magical prison unlike any other was conjured to keep the Dark Lords in eternal confinement. Thus Hollowmoor came to be. The cursed domain was devised as an instrument of endless torture and frustration where even the Dark Lords would be oblivious of their own fate in the grand apparatus. Their souls, black and empty such as they were, became forever bound to the lands of Hollowmoor. While immortal within their own dominion, the Dark Lords are utterly unable of escaping its narrow confines. But no prison is without flaw. While the barriers that confine the Dark Lords in their own personal hell are as powerful as ever, the borders of the prison have weakened, slowly spreading their cursed tendrils across the world.
Hollowmoor is a land of eternal torment and suffering where the tiniest bit of fortune quickly turns to bad luck. It is a place where even death does not provide escape from a harrowed life. The lamenting cries and the terror filled dreams of the population act as a beacon perceivable by Hollows, invisible monstrous creatures that stalk the countryside devouring the souls of the population, leaving them empty, soulless husks, sentenced to toil onto oblivion.
The very land of Hollowmoor is treacherous and wicked, and seems to have a will of its own, seemingly able to change beneath ones very feet. A villager might discover that a journey that usually takes but an hour, one that he has made dozens of times in the past, suddenly necessitates an arduous trek of a week or more. Such strangeness has a tendency to manifest at the worst possible moment, such as when ravenous Hollows worry a traveler's step.
A veil of misfortune and unrest plague the inhabitants of Hollowmoor, and thick magical mists spread from it. The Mists of Hollowmoor disorient and confuse all those who would enter them without a proper guide, seeping far and wide into the world, and sweeping up unwary travelers, merchants, and even entire villages back into the cursed lands."
#summary "Race: Various types of monsters. Dominion spreads unrest and Misfortune scales. Pretenders of Hollowmoor are incapable of leaving friendly dominion without dying. The lands are continuously covered in the Mists of Hollowmoor. Provinces with temples attract Hollows, and higher levels of dominion attract exponential numbers of Hollows.
Military: Undead giants, living, magical and undead troops. Light and medium infantry, missiles units, cavalry substitutes.
Magic: Death, Blood, Nature, some Fire, Astral, and Earth. Average priests.
Priests: Average."

#era 2
#descr "Tortuga, the pirate kingdom, is a divided society. Tortuga is not so much of a kingdom as it is a barely functioning group of cutthroat, treacherous and backstabbing pirate communities run by self-centered and short-lived Pirate Kings, always in war with one another and numerous other local lords, or even emperors. In times of crises - which are quite frequent due to the deleterious way of life brought on by unscrupulous political maneuverings and double dealings - pirates turn to Sea Witches and Sea Crone for advice and guidance. War is a constant in the everyday life. Pirates enjoy raiding and pillaging unsuspecting victims, and as such they rely on surprise attacks and their weaponry, which they carry in abundance, to carry the day. Pirates rarely use armor due to danger of going overboard and drowning when sailing across the seas."

Military: Heavily armed but lightly armored troops. Ocean sailing, stealthy units, cannons.
Magic: Water, Astral, Death, Air, Blood and Earth.
Priests: Weak. Can perform blood sacrifice."

#epithet "The Golden Tower"
#era 2
#descr "After a long and particularly bloody war, Aurum fell to a mysterious enemy. Cities were scorched to the ground, and walls that protected them crumbled into nothingness. A shadow of death swept across the Empire. Even the golden capital with all its splendor and glory, tall walls and brave men, fell to ruin. The Arkenstone Forges, the forges of gold which provided the nation with superior armaments, perished, and the great Golden Tower, a beacon of knowledge and the symbol of Aurumian power, was torn down. With the promise of restoring Aurum to its past glory, the Aurumian people have subjugated themselves to a new God. Aurum has been rebuilt with the forges of gold bustling with activity once again and the Golden Tower reconstructed. However, the scars of a devastating war still mark the golden city. Beneath the city undead hordes still roam the complex system of tunnels in the crypts known as the Undercity, and the once powerful Paragons now possess but a shadow of their former power."
#summary "Race: Strong humans and summonable undead.
Military: Extremely heavy infantry and cavalry, powerful sacreds with second form.
Magic: Fire, some Astral, some Earth, some Death, Nature. More diversity through summons. Powerful summons, unique units and various national spells.
Priests: Average. Powerful summonable priests."
#brief "Aurum is a human kingdom famous for its superior armor and weaponry. The majority of troops use heavy gold armor and weapons which are of better quality than any found in other lands. The Paragons of Aurum give good magical versatility and powerful battle magic."

#name "Edranor "
#epithet "Ten Thousand Spires"
#era 2
#descr "The powers of the mages of Edranor were well known across the lands. But though they were vast and astounding, their numbers were few and slow to increase, unlike those of the surrounding barbarian hordes that multiplied as quickly as weeds and were just as hard to eradicate. Fearful of the arcane powers of Edranor, the various barbaric tribes of old united in an attempt to perform genocide. Faced with overwhelming numbers, the mages of Edranor were forced to concede their lands, city by city, until they were brought to the very brink of ruin. It is then that a portion of mages attempted an ascension ritual in order to escape their seemingly inevitable deaths. Many mages ascended to a higher plane of existence but many more were left behind, now truly desperate and lost. Those that failed to ascend found themselves abandoned and were forced to flee in an effort to survive. Many years they spent on the run, their numbers ever dwindling until all hope was lost. It is then that the first Harrowing was undergone and the means of salvation, and indeed retribution, was discovered. Now, Edranor is a growing empire intent on collecting the long-owed debts in blood. The powers of the mages of Edranor are anchored in emotions, primarily those of hate, vengeance, and pain. As such, female mages are much more adept at wielding and practicing this particular brand of magic than males are, and as such hold the reigns of the society.
The people of Edranor have learnt to pay a heavy price for their powers and survival. Blood Hunting is accepted much more readily by the local population than in other lands. Their strife-filled history has made the mages of Edranor exceptionally xenophobic for they will continue to pacify the local population of friendly provinces until enemy dominion is completely removed. Roughly one percent of population will be killed each passing month and dominion reduced at a rate of one candle per three months."
#summary "Race: Spell-casting humans. Reduced unrest while Blood Hunting, up to 5 points per province. Dominion conflict bonus +1.
Military: A nation of mages who for the most part use spells instead of conventional weapons. Troops use enchanted robes instead of armor.
Magic: Fire, Air, Astral, Blood.
Priests: None. Preaching and temples have no effect. Dominion is spread via Blood Obelisks which are activated by spells.
Pretenders can be recalled by Blood Obelisks which have an equivalent power of H1."
#brief "A nations of mages whose powers come from demonic sources and are fueled by vengeance. They do not use conventional weapons but spells, rather. The mages of Edranor are very powerful, though fewer in number than other human nations."

#descr "When Death was let loose Ermor fell, but it did not fall alone. One by one the surrounding lands crumbled into ash before the onslaught on the ever-growing undead legions as the very land was stripped of life. Some managed to escape the impending doom however. They led what remained of their people away from the disintegrating empire and were soon met with refugees from other lands. But mere escape was not enough to save them as Death walked in their wake and threatened to consume them. The splintered nations banded together and formed a loose alliance and for the first time Death was held at bay, not by magic, or by faith, but through iron will and determination. Thus Fenrel was born. Fenrel is a newly-founded kingdom of exiles. Remnants of destroyed kingdoms band together to form Fenrel. The war machine of Fenrel has been modified to better fight the undead, and soldiers from various lands now complement each other."

Each of these realms makes extensive use of mercenaries rather than more traditional means to form armies and it is said that any man with a strong will and a quick sword arm can make his fortune there, with a little luck. Tilea is the foremost of the three realms and acts as a centre of trade, coin, and mercenary work for much of the Old World and beyond."

#descr "The lands of Nehekhara were once vast and fertile and for more than a thousand years it prospered and grew in influence, ruled by Priest Kings, each of whom controlled a city state. Greatest amongst the Priest Kings was Settra, first to unify Nehekhara under his authority, and it was Settra who brought the Mortuary Cult to power, for he wished to find a way to conquer death itself and rule eternally. Though the Cult could prolong the lives of their rulers greatly, they could not stave off death entirely, and instead promised a future glorious eternal afterlife. This promise led directly to the Nehekharan obsession with death and countless tombs were created to house the Royal families of Nehekhara as generations passed, until the riches of the dead far outweighed those of the living. Nehekhara's fate came in the form of Nagash, a genius Priest turned Necromancer who wrought the Great Ritual that laid waste to the land, slew every living soul, and bound the dead to his will in a state of undeath. Nagash was fortunately defeated and the risen Kings of Nehekhara regained their free will, but found they now ruled over a blasted land of undeath. Yet mummified undead Kings are Kings still, generations of rulers accustomed to unquestioned authority and power, and they now set forth with their numberless undead legions and animated statues to reclaim their lost empire."
#summary "Race: undead humans, prefers Heat Scale +2, halved income and pop loss from death
Military: shielded infantry, archers, and chariots with powerful and resilient animated statues
Magic: Death with Fire, Air, Astral, and Earth
Priests: Strong, with chants that strengthen the undead

#brief "Nehekhara was once a mighty nation of city states until its entire population was struck down by the necromancer Nagash and raised as his undead servants. With his defeat the Tomb Kings are free willed once more but cursed with undeath and obsessed with rebuilding their shattered kingdoms."

Though both have influenced Loringia, neither has ever managed to conquer it, and over the years it has become a hotbed of resentment against them.

The memory of the young empire's founder is still alive in the minds of many and Loringia's army is made up mostly of noble knights and their men at arms. Yet outside of their fortresses, the old traditions still cling on, and witches and warlocks dwell where the influence of the dual church does not reach."

Though both have influenced Loringia, neither has ever managed to conquer it, and over the years it has become a hotbed of resentment against them. Remnants of Ulm's Iron Cult and Marignons Inquisition have permeated society, retaining most of their old ways for neither were they bound to the dark pact of Marignon, nor cursed in the same way as Ulm. When the malediction devoured Ulm and demon worship corrupted Marignon, a new syncretic faith which opposed both was born. No longer shall humanity chafe under the yoke of demons from beyond, nor sustain those who have forsaken it in pursuit of immortality. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator the Church of the the Immaculate Flame, the holy Vehme and their allies prepare to purge the rot infesting humanity with fire and steel. For a long time Loringias military was made up of noble knights and their men at arms, but the time of chivalry is ending. Reliance on well drilled infantry and ranged weapons is increasing and landsknechts, battle hardened mercenaries in service of the empire, are now the backbone of Loringia's army."

It's inhabitants are called Niblung, each and every one a renowned craftsman of dwarven stature.
Their sinister nature and insatiable greed has transformed the oldest dwarves into great serpentine abominations,and even the weakest of them can take the shapes of great wyrms, should their lives or hoards be threatened.
The mightiest of them are the Kuningaz, sorcerer kings who have accumulated vast treasures in their halls below Gnipahellir. They yet refuse to serve the awakening god and a truly enormous bribe may be required to seduce them into servitude.
Stories of their riches have spread far, and adventurers from faraway Jotunheim and Vanheim often arrive to steal their treasures, assisted by lesser Niblungs who have grown envious of their betters' riches."

At the moment of her death, a Black Witch will invoke the Death Curse and fuel it with all the power she can access and the remainder of her quickly fading life-force. The curse's target is typically the witch's killer, though the curse can be directed at anyone, regardless of physical distance, and can even affected numerous people, or even a whole land. Some Black Witches have even been known to commit ritualistic suicides in order to cast especially powerful Death Curses."

#descr "The Harrowing is a ritual in which an Initiate's spirit is projected into the Demon Realm for a very short duration in an effort to attract a demonic entity. Demons are jealous creatures, envious of humans and the Terrestrial sphere. Even though they can manifest in any form they please, in their own domain they will still take the form of the mage they seek to devour, hoping to become them and take their place. Once faced with the demon, the Initiate will attempt to kill the fiend and take its powers for her own, merging the essence of the demon with that of herself, or die trying. Those who undergo the Harrowing are first forced to relive the most tragic events of their lives, reminding them of all the pain and suffering they've endured so far and reminding them of why the ritual must be performed. The Harrowing is an incredibly dangerous ritual and more often than not an Initiate who attempts to undergo it will perish, despite the numerous years of training, leaving behind but an empty husk, splayed across the floors of the Blood Spire. However, those who do survive survive it emerge from the ritual empowered and with renewed and seemingly endless wells of motivating hatred for outsiders. The Harrowing can be undergone just once, for any mages who tries to attempt it a second time will either die outright or find themselves permanently stuck in the Demon Realm, unable to return to their corporeal bodies in the Terrestrial Sphere.
The duty of initiating the Harrowing falls to the Avatars of Vengeance as well as the responsibility to slay the enslaved bodies of those Initiates who fail it, and end up possessed. The Harrowing is traditionally performed only once a month, and no more than one Initiate may undergo it."

The Mortuary Cult, at the height of their power before the rise of Nagash, constructed their own giant sentinels in honour of these legends, skeletal titans made of black marble known as Necrolith Colossi. To each Colossus was bound the spirit of a heroic warrior, a willing sacrifice made to protect the Tomb of their King that he might reach the glorious afterlife promised to him. By calling out to the spirit of the warrior still bound to the silent Colossus and infusing its black marble bones with magic, the caster awakens one of these protectors of Nehekhara to march to war once more. The awakened Colossus will be armed with either a massive khopesh or a powerful bow capable of drawing power from the underworld."

Traveling the Mists without a Misty Ferryman for extended periods of time is often very dangerous and can end in tragedy more often than not."

Many a pirate says that any time Miss Fortune sets sail from Tortuga hard winds push her sails at impossible speeds all the way to the shores of her desire, as if guided by magic.
Miss Fortune's tricorne hat is her good luck charm and she never sails without it."

#msg "Suddenly Elbus Bloodworth the Gibbering Prophet appeared at the gates of your Castle and wanted to fight for your cause!
Elbus Bloodworth was once a devout man of the cloth and faith. He served his god with utter commitment and was blessed with foresight. But then one day the Mists came and swept him away to the cursed domain of the Dark Lords, Hollowmoor. Upon laying his eyes on the twisted rulers of the dark land he tore his eyes from their sockets and ran shrieking into the shadows, wailing maniacally that the end was upon them all. Nothing the Dark Lords did could stop the mad ravings of the prophet. He survived the drowning in the icy river, the stockades, and even the knives delivered so enthusiastically into his back. When he returning time and time again, to rouse the townsfolk with his prophecies, he would prognosticates that, left unchecked, the Dark Lords wound soon unleash doom upon the world."

#msg "Suddenly Lord Draven the Ghast appeared at the gates of your Castle and wanted to fight for your cause!
For long has Lord Draven been wandering the cursed domain of Hollowmoor, still unaware of even having been swept away to a strange land by the Mists so many decades ago. Not that something so trivial would ever detour him from his sacred quest to hunt down his poisoner, the wretched woman who had turned him into a ghoulish creature and took away everything from him, his lands, his wealth, his family. Lord Draven stalks the lands of Hollowmoor carrying a long chain with a sickle attached to it, which he uses to hunt down his victims and slowly disembowel them."
