These spirits are relics of ancient times from when the world was still young, and are held in a lesser degree of reverence in the Nether Realm. The countless years these creatures have misspent in lamentation and woe causes them to hold a tenuous grasp on the physical realm, at best. While they can no longer harm the living or interact with the material realm, they can project their own woe and torment onto others. Those who fail to resist these projections will quickly despair, falling silent as the grave and succumbing to a catatonic state, their vigor stripped from their bodies as surely as hope is stripped from their hearts. Powerful magical protection and a strong will may offer some protection from the soul-wrenching projections of the Sanctified Dead."

Over hundreds of years the Order served kingdoms and empires to fight the hosts of the Nether Realms, and hunted infernal and dread beings where they secretly skulked. Its knights fought valiantly wherever forces of darkness threatened. But over time their numbers grew thin and their struggle grew desperate. Worse, they were blamed for the coming of the Nether beings and exiled from the lands. Embittered by the ingratitude and cruelty of those they protected, they undertook one last quest to put an end to their long struggle. They achieved their goal only in tragic irony; during the course of their quest they succumbed to their hatred and turned it upon humanity itself. Weary and vengeful, they cast aside their bond to mankind and offered their service to the Nether Realms. Now, riding their shadowy steeds, they bring death and misery to those they once protected."

Over hundreds of years the Order served kingdoms and empires to fight the hosts of the Nether Realms, and hunted infernal and dread beings where they secretly skulked. Its knights fought valiantly wherever forces of darkness threatened. But over time their numbers grew thin and their struggle grew desperate. Worse, they were blamed for the coming of the Nether beings and exiled from the lands. Embittered by the ingratitude and cruelty of those they protected, they undertook one last quest to put an end to their long struggle. They achieved their goal only in tragic irony; during the course of their quest they succumbed to their hatred and turned it upon humanity itself. Weary and vengeful, they cast aside their bond to mankind and offered their service to the Nether Realms. Now, riding their shadowy steeds, they bring death and misery to those they once protected."

#name "Banewyrm"
#descr "The Banewyrm is an ancient dragon of tremendous physical and magical power. Born in the hazy age before the written records of men, it has grown in might and magical mastery to such a degree that it now seeks to transcend existence and ascend to become Pantokrator. It is an enormous, scaly, winged beast constantly ablaze in banefire. The very earth cracks and trembles before the might of the Banewyrm. Because its physical body is not well suited for spell casting, it tends to adopt a humanoid form, but, when wounded, it reverts to its greater Banewyrm form."

#descr "The Nightshade Brazier is an ominous and ancient spirit who inhabits a huge Skull Cairn which contains a richly-ornamented brazier of sickly bane fire, embedded at its top with countless death gems in which the spirit resides. It has become well-versed in death magic and knows how to manipulate the energies of the Nether Realm to shroud the surrounding lands in darkness. The sickening glow of the brazier and the Skull Cairn is terrifying to behold even from miles away. To accomplish its desires, the spirit of the Nightshade Brazier possesses a willing target to perform tasks such as forging and enchanting items. It is tremendously strong in dominion, magically-powerful, and difficult to destroy."

#descr "Once a member of an prominent assassins' guild, the being known as Deathblade was the most talented of its members. Entrusted with the most challenging and difficult assassinations, from high and well-guarded nobles to even kings, he quickly rose in the guild's hierarchy by virtue of his ingenuity and skill. He would have inevitably became the guildmaster were it not for his own assassination by the more envious members of the guild. Now, reawakened by the dark God of Eljudnir, Deathblade employs his talents once again, driven by his ambition and his hatred for those who once betrayed him."

#descr "Even before the Dread Liches breached the veil between the two realms and opened the Nether Portal, thereby commencing the crusade against the living in an effort to purge all life, there were other passageways between the realms. These entrances were guarded by the Keeper. The Keeper is an ancient mage of great power and renown who was among the first beings in the world to discover the secrets of Death and necromancy. For unleashing such evils upon the world, he was cursed for his foolishness and impudence to forever guard the entry into the realm of Death. Long since has he kept vigil, but now, with the arrival of the new God, the bonds that shackled and bound him to these portals are slowly breaking away. The Keeper is still bound to the passageways between the two realms, and he cannot venture far from them without wasting away."

The Dark Wanderer always skins and crucifies his last victim, carrying his flailing corpse as an omen of impending death to those that oppose him. The Dark Wanderer must always compete in the Arena deathmatch, claiming the lives of all those who participate."

But all of his refinement and accomplishment meant nothing when his father's lordly title was to be inherited, for he was the second-born son and would get nothing. Denied what he felt was his rightful inheritance, Eolian listened to the whispering dreams of death and soon became enticed with the promises of eternal life and power. He orchestrated a great feast where he slaughtered his family and their entire household using black magic, opening the portal to the Nether Realm and establishing the Second Realm of Death. For his services, Eolian was granted great and terrifying powers, and wields command over the knightly wraith order. Eolian now grows in power with each passing month by consuming the souls of his former countrymen."

#descr "Eolian was once a famous noble of great wealth and fine lineage in Eljudnir. The ambitious noble was tutored by the pre-eminent scholars and philosophers of his age, and was well-versed in swordplay and arts. But all of his refinement and accomplishment meant nothing when his father's lordly title was to be inherited, for he was the second-born son and would get nothing. Denied what he felt was his rightful inheritance, Eolian listened to the whispering dreams of death and soon became enticed with the promises of eternal life and power. He orchestrated a great feast where he slaughtered his family and their entire household using black magic, opening the portal to the Nether Realm and establishing the Second Realm of Death. For his services, Eolian was granted great and terrifying powers, and wields command over the knightly wraith order. Eolian now grows in power with each passing month by consuming the souls of his former countrymen."

Awakened by the presence of the Unholy Announcers, they emerge from their tombs and crypts with rusty weapons and armor. In cold dominion their brittle bones are tempered and hardened, and their powers are increased. Impalers are skilled fighters and do not rout unless their master is killed. They are mindless and will quickly dissolve if they are broken on the battlefield."

Though they are skilled warriors, their abilities with a blade and bow honed and perfected over the countless seasons of their near-immortal lives, most fea are not very disciplined due to their fickleness and excessive hubris. Their false bravado, wrought from arrogance and a sense of superiority, is easily shattered when the Fay fail to easily dominate the battlefield as they are so typically accustomed, making the armies of Elphame, composed of opposing  and ever-scheming courts, as well as the wild Fay, prone to breaking or even turning on each other.
To most mortal men the Fay will appear stalwart and imposing on the surface, implacable and majestic beings as as unlikely to give way as a particularly stubborn mountain, but counter to their outward appearance, if the Fay actually feel threatened and in danger, they will try to slip away from danger."

#descr "Many fables and near-forgotten stories talk of strange faery doorways that lead to distant places, magical portals and paths where one might go down a seemingly simple trail and by accident emerge in a place distant and foreign, hundreds of leagues away. Even among the long-lived Fay most such trails remain an ancient mystery to all but a select few. Being utterly alien and functioning counter to any expected logic, such paths remain virtually undetectable to all despite often existing in plain sight. Some of the these long-forgotten faery path that stretch the length of the world have even been repurposed by oblivious peoples at the dawn of their civilization who built their own roads on top of these already existing faery paths. A path going around the edges of a small grove might transport a person who chooses to walk it counter-clockwise three times in a circle half a world away. A dusty old road leading into a small town might send one traveling it far into the far-flung mountains if one were to step away from it just a league before town, and then walk backwards for a length.
Among the Fay, such paths are best known to Fay Assassins and some of the more mysterious wild fay. The assassins of Elphame often use such paths to quickly travel between places through paths unknown and seldom guarded. The swiftness with which the assassins can travel from one place to another depends entirely on their knowledge of the intricate web of faery paths that connect all places. Consequently, the speed with which one may travel these hidden paths depends entirely on one's ability to find them and know where they might lead.
Fay Assassins will have varying and unpredictable amounts of map movements each month, but never less than their basic map movement."

#descr "Many fables and near-forgotten stories talk of strange faery doorways that lead to distant places, magical portals and paths where one might go down a seemingly simple trail and by accident emerge in a place distant and foreign, hundreds of leagues away. Even among the long-lived Fay most such trails remain an ancient mystery to all but a select few. Being utterly alien and functioning counter to any expected logic, such paths remain virtually undetectable to all despite often existing in plain sight. Some of the these long-forgotten faery path that stretch the length of the world have even been repurposed by oblivious peoples at the dawn of their civilization who built their own roads on top of these already existing faery paths. A path going around the edges of a small grove might transport a person who chooses to walk it counter-clockwise three times in a circle half a world away. A dusty old road leading into a small town might send one traveling it far into the far-flung mountains if one were to step away from it just a league before town, and then walk backwards for a length.
Among the Fay, such paths are best known to Fay Assassins and some of the more mysterious wild fay. The assassins of Elphame often use such paths to quickly travel between places through paths unknown and seldom guarded. The swiftness with which the assassins can travel from one place to another depends entirely on their knowledge of the intricate web of faery paths that connect all places. Consequently, the speed with which one may travel these hidden paths depends entirely on one's ability to find them and know where they might lead.
Fay Assassins will have varying and unpredictable amounts of map movements each month, but never less than their basic map movement."

#descr "Many fables and near-forgotten stories talk of strange faery doorways that lead to distant places, magical portals and paths where one might go down a seemingly simple trail and by accident emerge in a place distant and foreign, hundreds of leagues away. Even among the long-lived Fay most such trails remain an ancient mystery to all but a select few. Being utterly alien and functioning counter to any expected logic, such paths remain virtually undetectable to all despite often existing in plain sight. Some of the these long-forgotten faery path that stretch the length of the world have even been repurposed by oblivious peoples at the dawn of their civilization who built their own roads on top of these already existing faery paths. A path going around the edges of a small grove might transport a person who chooses to walk it counter-clockwise three times in a circle half a world away. A dusty old road leading into a small town might send one traveling it far into the far-flung mountains if one were to step away from it just a league before town, and then walk backwards for a length.
Among the Fay, such paths are best known to Fay Assassins and some of the more mysterious wild fay. The assassins of Elphame often use such paths to quickly travel between places through paths unknown and seldom guarded. The swiftness with which the assassins can travel from one place to another depends entirely on their knowledge of the intricate web of faery paths that connect all places. Consequently, the speed with which one may travel these hidden paths depends entirely on one's ability to find them and know where they might lead.
Fay Assassins will have varying and unpredictable amounts of map movements each month, but never less than their basic map movement."

The magic of the Spring and Summer courts favors elemental Fire magic in addition to illusory and Nature magic that all Seelie Fay are innately drawn to.

#descr "Each of the four courts of Elphame reflects the spirit of the world during the time of its rule, and is aligned or attuned to one of the four elements, and either the power over Life, or Death, depending on its temperament and inclination towards one or the other. The Summer Court is one of fiery splendor and majesty. Truly, of the four, it is unparalleled in beauty, which is only matched by its passion and exuberance. Its season is a time for lovers, starry eyed and star-crossed, but also scorned and spurned. The powers of the Summer Court are tied to the elemental and wild magic of Fire, and to a lesser degree the power over Nature, or rather Life itself. Much like that of all the Seasonal Courts, the powers of the Summer Court wax and wane with the passing of the seasons, slowly growing until they reach their height mid-Summer, and then continuously eroding until they reach their lowest point during mid-Winter, the season of their arch rivals and polar opposites, the Winter Fay.
The power of the Summer Queens will shift with the passing of seasons, increasing or decreasing. Furthermore, much like the Seelie Fay, the Summer Queens have a 15% chance to cast a random spell instead of a scripted one."

#descr "Each of the four courts of Elphame reflects the spirit of the world during the time of its rule, and is aligned or attuned to one of the four elements, and either the power over Life, or Death, depending on its temperament and inclination towards one or the other. The Autumn Court is wise, reflective, but mournful overall, for it announces the passing of life and frailty of all things. Its rule signifies the inevitability and tragedy of death. The rule of Autumn is perhaps feared even more than that of Winter itself. Though Winter is death and darkness incarnate, cruel, vicious, and finite; Autumn is the slow process of dying and decay, of life slowly stripped of all joy and pleasure. Many might not fear death itself, but few are dauntless when faced with a downfall prolonged and unabrupt. The powers of the Autumn Court are tied to the elemental magic of the Earth, and to a lesser degree the power over Death itself. Much like that of all the Seasonal Courts, the powers of the Autumn Court wax and wane with the passing of the seasons, slowly growing until they reach their height mid-Autumn, and then continuously eroding until they reach their lowest point during mid-Spring, the season of their arch rivals and polar opposites, the Spring Fay.
The power of the Autumn Queens will shift with the passing of seasons, increasing or decreasing. Furthermore, much like the Unseelie Fay, the Autumn Queens have a 15% chance to cast a random spell instead of a scripted one."

The powers of the Summer Court are tied to the elemental and wild magic of Fire, and to a lesser degree the power over Nature, or rather Life itself. Much like that of all the Seasonal Courts, the powers of the Summer Court wax and wane with the passing of the seasons, slowly growing until they reach their height mid-Summer, and then continuously eroding until they reach their lowest point during mid-Winter, the season of their arch rivals and polar opposites, the Winter Fay.
The power of the Summer Queens will shift with the passing of seasons, increasing or decreasing. Furthermore, much like the Seelie Fay, the Summer Queens have a 15% chance to cast a random spell instead of a scripted one."

#descr "Each of the four courts of Elphame reflects the spirit of the world during the time of its rule, and is aligned or attuned to one of the four elements, and either the power over Life, or Death, depending on its temperament and inclination towards one or the other. The Autumn Court is wise, reflective, but mournful overall, for it announces the passing of life and frailty of all things. Its rule signifies the inevitability and tragedy of death. The rule of Autumn is perhaps feared even more than that of Winter itself. Though Winter is death and darkness incarnate, cruel, vicious, and finite; Autumn is the slow process of dying and decay, of life slowly stripped of all joy and pleasure. Many might not fear death itself, but few are dauntless when faced with a downfall prolonged and unabrupt. The powers of the Autumn Court are tied to the elemental magic of the Earth, and to a lesser degree the power over Death itself. Much like that of all the Seasonal Courts, the powers of the Autumn Court wax and wane with the passing of the seasons, slowly growing until they reach their height mid-Autumn, and then continuously eroding until they reach their lowest point during mid-Spring, the season of their arch rivals and polar opposites, the Spring Fay.
The power of the Autumn Queens will shift with the passing of seasons, increasing or decreasing. Furthermore, much like the Unseelie Fay, the Autumn Queens have a 15% chance to cast a random spell instead of a scripted one."

There are many tales that recount when people caught by the faeries would steadily look at them, they would sometimes appear as dead neighbors, deceased lovers, or family members long since lost. For this reason many perceive faeries as the untimely dead who left unfinished lives, a view which might explains why Faery Godmothers when summoned by mortals, typically children, take such great care to protect them from danger, perhaps on account of being the deceased family members of those who seek or need their help.
Though Faery Godmothers stem from the Winter Court, shrouded in icy winds, horrifying to behold and immensely cruel and wicked, they still take exceptional care of their charges in as much as their nature allows them, and only show the true colours of their madness to those who would attempt to harm those they protect."

#descr "It is said that Faery Dragons cannot die and continue to live a half-life even after their corporeal forms have been destroyed. The torrents of magic that flows through these creatures keep them alive long after they have been slayed. Those Faery Dragons which are killed simply rise up as ghostly apparitions of themselves, reanimated by the vast wells of magic coursing innate in their kind. Ghost Dragons are largely the antithesis of what they were in life. The once beautiful creatures with striking, iridescent scales now appear as nightmare fuel for all those manage to somehow steal a look. Their very presence seems to inspire a sense of dread and foreboding and bad things happen to those near one. Though these frighting creatures can no longer wield magic or heal themselves as they could in life, they can now sap the life force of others to replenish themselves, and even shred and corrupt the souls of those they touch, trapping them in unlife too. Ghost Dragons are exceedingly malevolent creatures and belong to the deepest recesses of Winter, reserved for those most horrifying creatures of faery."

They are deceptively charming and striking creatures with iridescent coat of scales that reflects all colors of the rainbow, but predominantly reflects one particular color which changes with their mood. In truth, Faerie Dragons are mischievous and whimsical creatures, far worse than any group of Pixies. Little is known about these notorious troublemakers. What sparse knowledge exists is more readily found in storybooks and children's tales than magical tomes. Some say they are invisible. Some say they can cast spells better than any sorcerer. Some say they have magical scales that are resilient to all forms of magic and even weapons.
Faery Dragons are innately magical creatures capable of drawing upon ambient magic to instinctively cast a wide array of powerful spells despite having no actual magical talent or training. Besides their ability to cast spells, they are also capable of drawing on the same ambient magic to quickly heal and knit lesser wounds inflicted upon them. However, if seriously wounded in battle, the Faery Dragons will lose both their ability to cast spells and heal themselves, and will instead resort to striking out with their claws and teeth. Unlike regular dragons, Faery Dragons exhale a cone of magic gas that bewilders and confuses those bathed in it, allowing the Faery Dragon to slip away when seriously wounded and pressed. Faery Dragons will not resort to using their magic breath unless they are seriously threatened in battle.
Faery Dragons are capable of casting a plethora of different and powerful spells. Each battle round a random spell from a set will be chosen and cast, and all wounds inflicted will be instantly healed. Should a Faery Dragon be sufficiently wounded in battle - and forced into its second shape - it will lose its ability to cast spells and heal itself for the remainder of the battle."

#descr "Elphame is home to many mystical and fantastical creatures, but perhaps none more so than the fascinating Faery Dragons. They are deceptively charming and striking creatures with iridescent coat of scales that reflects all colors of the rainbow, but predominantly reflects one particular color which changes with their mood. In truth, Faerie Dragons are mischievous and whimsical creatures, far worse than any group of Pixies. Little is known about these notorious troublemakers. What sparse knowledge exists is more readily found in storybooks and children's tales than magical tomes. Some say they are invisible. Some say they can cast spells better than any sorcerer. Some say they have magical scales that are resilient to all forms of magic and even weapons.
Faery Dragons are innately magical creatures capable of drawing upon ambient magic to instinctively cast a wide array of powerful spells despite having no actual magical talent or training. Besides their ability to cast spells, they are also capable of drawing on the same ambient magic to quickly heal and knit lesser wounds inflicted upon them. However, if seriously wounded in battle, the Faery Dragons will lose both their ability to cast spells and heal themselves, and will instead resort to striking out with their claws and teeth. Unlike regular dragons, Faery Dragons exhale a cone of magic gas that bewilders and confuses those bathed in it, allowing the Faery Dragon to slip away when seriously wounded and pressed. Faery Dragons will not resort to using their magic breath unless they are seriously threatened in battle.
Faery Dragons are capable of casting a plethora of different and powerful spells. Each battle round a random spell from a set will be chosen and cast, and all wounds inflicted will be instantly healed. Should a Faery Dragon be sufficiently wounded in battle - and forced into its second shape - it will lose its ability to cast spells and heal itself for the remainder of the battle."

#descr "Elphame is home to many mystical and fantastical creatures, but perhaps none more so than the fascinating Faery Dragons. They are deceptively charming and striking creatures with iridescent coat of scales that reflects all colors of the rainbow, but predominantly reflects one particular color which changes with their mood. In truth, Faerie Dragons are mischievous and whimsical creatures, far worse than any group of Pixies. Little is known about these notorious troublemakers. What sparse knowledge exists is more readily found in storybooks and children's tales than magical tomes. Some say they are invisible. Some say they can cast spells better than any sorcerer. Some say they have magical scales that are resilient to all forms of magic and even weapons.
Faery Dragons are innately magical creatures capable of drawing upon ambient magic to instinctively cast a wide array of powerful spells despite having no actual magical talent or training. Besides their ability to cast spells, they are also capable of drawing on the same ambient magic to quickly heal and knit lesser wounds inflicted upon them. However, if seriously wounded in battle, the Faery Dragons will lose both their ability to cast spells and heal themselves, and will instead resort to striking out with their claws and teeth. Unlike regular dragons, Faery Dragons exhale a cone of magic gas that bewilders and confuses those bathed in it, allowing the Faery Dragon to slip away when seriously wounded and pressed. Faery Dragons will not resort to using their magic breath unless they are seriously threatened in battle.
Faery Dragons are capable of casting a plethora of different and powerful spells. Each battle round a random spell from a set will be chosen and cast, and all wounds inflicted will be instantly healed. Should a Faery Dragon be sufficiently wounded in battle - and forced into its second shape - it will lose its ability to cast spells and heal itself for the remainder of the battle."

Being wholly uncivilized, savage daemons are prone to fits of extreme aggression, rage, and impulsiveness. They are large, wild, beastly beings with horns and unkempt hair. The very nature of the savage daemons is driven by pure instinct, and they respond directly and immediately to basic urges, needs, and desires. They are primitive and irrational creatures. The secrets of metalworking, let alone of other fine arts, still elude them and as such most savage daemons use simple wooden clubs, rocks, or anything else at hand while fulfilling their short-term and selfish ambitions. Still, with the arrival of the Demiurges the small and widely spread daemonic tribes have slowly started to rise out of darkness and ignorance, adopting the strange concepts brought by the gods."

These daemons belong to neither of the worlds they've left behind, rejected by their savage brethren whom they abandoned for Khora and who now deem them corrupted by the new gods, but also snubbed by their civilized brethren who yet remain in Khora. Twice damned for abandoning their fellows, these daemons now live in relative seclusion, ever keeping to the shadows and out of sight. During bright and cloudless nights they will venture out and gather in forest glades they have come to call their own, and sing the songs they have learned under the tutelage of the Demiurges in the long years spent in Khora, and others yet they have since composed themselves in their self-inflicted exile. Much like the rest of the civilized daemons, Twilight Daemons too have shed much of their aggression, rage, and some of their brutish and unkempt stature, but have also learnt to stay hidden and out of sight.
Twilight Daemons will often sing and play their harps as they go into battle, both rallying and inspiring their allies and befuddling their foes. Those enemies who hear the enchanting twilight spellsongs will find themselves smitten and bewitched for a moment at the impossibility of hearing such divine music coming from profane creatures such as deamons.
Roughly one in five recruited Twilight Daemons will be equipped with a Daemonic Harp."

These individuals preside over all things daemonic and lead their people, a difficult and often taxing task for even the deamons of Khora, inhibited and restrained as they are compared to their savage brethren, can prove to be exceptionally contrary and difficult to lead and battle."

Such daemons belong to the shadows and the darkest recesses of the land and they are called the daemons of the twilight. It is the Twilight Lords who preside over all matters relating to the daemons of the twilight, and navigate their kin through the dangerous wilds. Even in this the Demiurges have a purpose, for as much as the role of the daemons is to bridge the mortal sphere and the divine, it is the role of the twilight daemons to bridge the savages and Khora. Though daemons of the twilight mostly keep to themselves, their very existence among the savage tribes spreads the influence of the Demiurges; their art, knowledge, and wisdom."

Though they possessed no sophisticated musical instruments, the tribes still sang their primitive odes. Those daemons of Khora quickly adapted to the grand instruments devised by the Nine, and their enchanting spellsongs, though in time they also devised their own instruments and songs. In the wilderness, under cold moonlit skies, the twilight troubadours have mastered the art of seduction.

Though they possessed no sophisticated musical instruments, the tribes still sang their primitive odes. Those daemons of Khora quickly adapted to the grand instruments devised by the Nine, and their enchanting spellsongs, though in time they also devised their own instruments and songs.

#descr "Though no daemon disputes the great power of the Demiurges, deamonic philosophers contest their claims of divinity. They argue there is but one thing greater than the self, that being the inner-self, the hidden spirit, the slumbering mind waiting to be fully awakened. Daemonic philosophers gather and speculate about the nature of their being and their unseen guide, their inner-daemon that frequently warns against prospective actions though never urges them on. They believe it is this silent counterpart of their instinctual being that keeps them in check and separates the daemonic tribes from mere senseless animals."

As such it is little wonder they make for remarkable musicians and singers, and why the Demiurges take such great interest in them. Daemons are quick to pick up and master any musical instrument and seem to possess an innate understanding of the complex spellsongs of the Demiurges. With the coming of The Nine and the revealing of the secrets of smithing and metallurgy, daemons have since learnt to create their own musical instruments and compose their own symphonies."

In fact, much like divinity is what gods are, music is what the Demiurges are inside their formless interval, their immaterial non-realm. They are an endless note that resonates across the spheres, bringing with it, or perhaps giving birth to creation itself. The Demiurges are the shapers of the material realms. From their songs was the universe spun into being and all within it, and when the Music of the Sphere is ended, so will the universe. There are but nine primordial Demiurges in existence. Though after countless eons their descendants may now number many, they are nowhere as powerful as the Nine. Even so, their songs have been known to give birth to wondrous things. The Nine are eternal beings. Stemming from the formless interval, they are immaterial for they have no need of physical shapes. However, in the mortal realms the Nine take the shapes of towering and majestic centaur-like beings. They are immortal and completely unkillable by any means even in their restrained physical vessels, though they can still be banished from the material realm back to their formless interval."

However, unlike other Demiurges, they spend considerable time in the material universe. It is said that all the stars in all the skies were shaped by the Sagittarians, for their song is prophetic and they see all that is, was, and ever will be, and thus know the universe and all the stars are theirs to shape. Somewhat more accustomed to this physical form of existence, the Sagittarians are even more imposing than the rest of the Demiurges, including the Nine. Being what they are, the song yet to be sung, Sagittarians have perfect vision and perfect foresight, and thus their arrows never fail to hit their mark, even if it might sometimes seem that way. Such an existence is surely an onerous one, for the Sagittarians are ultimately locked in their destinies and deprived of free will and choice, for all their great deeds have already come to pass, even though they are yet to undertake them."

Desert Flamers come from one of the more mystical tribes of Musafir that hold the secret of contained fire. These travelers carry with them highly flammable alchemical compounds stored in delicate glass spheres. When thrown, the spheres will shatter upon impact, bursting into flames and engulfing all those standing nearby. The Desert Flames are extreemly effective vs targets that wear nothing more than highly-flammable cloth or leather armor, such as those often worn by most Musafir tribes. As such it is little wonder that those in possession of the Desert Flame's secret were once highly revered and avoided. Though battling these flames is not impossible, it is exceedingly dangerous in the scorching deserts where both rain and water are an extremely rare sight."

Poisoners are commonly regarded by the travelers as being exceptionally skilled hunters for indeed the alternative to being a skilled hunter would almost certainly be death in their world. These hardened desert recluses hunt the gigantic Black Scorpions that dwell in the deserts of Musafir and extract poison from their glands which they use to coat their arrows with. The scorpion venom acts as a paralytic and is strong enough to immobilize those hit by it."

The Desert Outriders prefer to ride horses to the much more widely used camels due to their often great need for haste. These horsemen typically scout ahead of big caravans or traveling tribes, or act as vanguards. As such Desert Outriders need to be able to cross great distances at times and only employ the fastest horses. Though they are equipped with much lighter gear than most other light cavalry, the tremendous force of their charge has been often known to break well equipped and well armored ranks. The remarkable speed of their horses also allows them to run down any stragglers after a minor skirmish, or outrun a superior army that seeks to engage a poorly equipped force."

In years past they used to roam the deserts in search of prey, frequently targeting small and poorly equipped bands of travelers which they would then sell into slavery at slave auctions. More recently, however, with the ban on tribal slavery, the slave trade has shifted to enslaving the Tigrans, a race of tigers that dwell in the forests or open savanna plains. While the Tigrans are a fierce and proud race, the cat people are still unsophisticated and relatively easy to catch with nets and fast horses, which has lead the slavers to abandon their classical camel mounts in favor of fast horses. Most slavers are somewhat cowardly. If they find prey capable of mounting a resistance they will more often than not retreat and seek out easier victims instead."

In Musafir, there would likely be no traveling tribes without camels so it is little wonder that these beasts hold a special significance and are considered to be almost holy. Their worth is such that it is said that a Musafir husband takes better care of his camels than he does of his wives. Indeed, the wives of Musafir take care of their husbands, the husbands take care of the camels, and in turn the camels provide for them all. Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitats and are a vital means of transport for nomads and their cargo. On the long journeys they provide milk and meat and even textiles as the clothes the nomads wear and the tents they sleep in are woven out of camel hair. A tribe's wealth is often measured in the number of camels it possesses. In times of war, these great beasts are also used as battle mounts. Though not as fast as Musafir horse breeds, the dromedary of Musafir are much more reliable, capable of going up to several days without water, and easier to ride."

#descr "Within the barren and scorching deserts of Musafir there exists but a single settlement, indeed now a sprawling city by any measure, that has never been abandoned like all the countless settlements both large and small that scatter with the winds as easily as the ever shifting sand. This sacred city is an oasis for all the numerous tribes of Musafir, where feuds of old are suspended, if not entirely forgotten. Violence of any kind between the tribes of Musafir within the sacred city of Musafir is strictly forbidden and any offenders are punished with a swift and almost casual brutality.
The Guardians of the Oasis are holy warriors of Musafir tasked with the sacred duty of protecting the city of Musafir and keeping the peace between the many tribes that dwell there. Due to the respect the people of Musafir have for the city, violence within it is rare and peace thus easily maintained. Even so, the Guardians of the Oasis are particularly well equipped compared to other warriors of Musafir, and their skills unmatched in the desert. The armor of these warriors is of much better quality and the weapons they carry are strange spear-like weapons with a sickle at the end.  "

#name "War Elephant"
#descr "Though most of Musafir consists of endless, sprawling deserts, there yet exist rare patches of fertile land and bountiful oases, teeming with life. Here, many rare breeds of animals can be found and among them even elephants. Trained for use in battle, their sheer size allows them to trample soldiers and horses. Elephants are intelligent beings with minds of their own. Once hurt, they become enraged and terrified, seeking to leave the battlefield by the shortest possible route and trampling friends and enemies alike. The War Elephants of Musafir are mounted with two booming war drums which, coupled with the their great size, makes for an ominous presence on the battlefield."

#name "Gargantua"
#descr "Endemic to the desert plains of Musafir, the Gargantua is the largest animal known to the Travelers. It is believed that these animals continue to grow in size their entire lives, until they grow so huge, that finally, their enormous tusks outweigh the rest of their body and the beasts collapse, unable to bear their own weight. The Gargantua are exceedingly rare for a number of reasons, chief among them being the vast appetites of these beasts in the near-lifeless deserts. Though these lumbering beasts are slow, they are still considerably dangerous, capable of crushing anything beneath their imposing bodies. A tamed Gargantua is a pack beast like no other, easily able to carry the weight of an entire caravan. The Gargantua is like a mobile fortress which is why it is especially favored among the Tajir of Musafir, the spice merchants and traders that are under constant risk of being raided due to the valuables they carry. It is perhaps due to the Tajir that these beasts have survived for so long as they rely on the merchants for food as much as the merchants rely on them for protection. The Gargantua are strange beasts capable of producing metallic shrieks that cut straight into the minds of all those nearby, paralyzing them for a moment. They are also seemingly completely oblivious to any sense of danger, perhaps due to their sheer size and lack of natural predators. The body of a Gargantua is near impervious to damage, its leather being incredibly thick and tough."

Only the Slaver Masters of Sharir are privy to such an important secret for the value of trained Rocs to the Sharir is too important to be shared under any circumstances. The Rocs are fiercely intelligent creatures and are trained by the Slave Masters to transport cargo in huge cages. The type of cargo the Sharir usually transport in these massive cages leaves little room for speculation, though the cages themselves are large enough to transport even elephants or gargantua, and are even used to transport the Sharir secretly to distant lands on occasion as well. Rocs rule the skies of the desert plains of Musaif. They are capable of shifting the colors of their features in quick succession, mesmerizing and entrancing any potential onlookers. Once in such a hypnotic state, the Rocs will grab and fly off with the unfortunate victims, likely to be devoured by this carnivorous bird, or fed to its younglings."

Though historically the tribes of Musafir often competed against each other over access to the small patches of rich grassland and the sporadic oasis, as of late the tribes have banded together to form a lose coalition under the new, self-proclaimed god of the Harsh Sands. In times of war, the Wise Masters will lead the warriors of their tribes on mounted camels into battle personally, for a tribe lives or dies together, both man and camel alike."

A Slave Master with no less than five Slavers under his command will capture as many as one hundred and fifty people a month in non-Musafir lands to be brought back to the lands of Musafir in chains and sold at slaver markets.
This Slave Master is in the process of selling captures slave to the locals."

#descr "Being a wandering people, constantly on the move, the nomads of Musafir travel far and wide. On their distant journeys they always acquire new, exotic things that can often be sold for a hefty profit in some other part of the world. These tribes that travel between other tribes of Musafir are the Tajir, or the traveling merchants. Spice Caravans are formed from groups of merchants who traverse the world and make their living selling spices in various tribes and settlements. Due to their particular way of life, the Tajir have become crafty and skilled salesmen and are well known for driving a hard price if a lucrative business opportunity is at hand.
Spice Caravans travel within the confines of the borders of Musafir, always moving from city to city, selling their goods to the locals. Though the prices they fetch selling their spices in friendly Musafir settlements are favorable, they are not as favorable as those the Distant Spice Caravans fetch traveling to other, distant nations where such goods are rare and luxurious. Though the Spice Caravans do not follow the Spice Trail to other realms, they are still capable of fetching considerable profits in those lands where a Musafir settlement is located.
Spice Caravans can trade by entering other Musafir settlements, those of Azraq, Slavers, Farseers, and other Tajir. No more than two caravans a month can hope to sell their goods at any given Musafir settlement before the saturation of the market drives down the price too much for a profit to be had."

The price a Distant Spice Caravan can fetch in a foreign city is considerably higher than those had in Musafir Settlements. Many a caravan even take the long journeys to the sprawling markets in the capital cities of distant lands. The profit to be had in such a venture can be enough to set a trader up for life, though the trip is often not one without risk either, as the caravans sometimes get attacked during their travel and even betrayed by those they traded with by being rounded up and executed after.
Distant Spice Caravans can trade by entering the cities of other nation. No more than two caravans a month can hope to sell their goods at any given distant city before the laden caravans of Musafir saturate the market and drive down the price too much. Distant Spice Caravans can also gauge their prices in foreign capitals, though traveling such vast distances can be dangerous and incur great upkeep expenses during the many-month travel."

#descr "Slaver Caravans have become an ever increasing sight in Musafir. Though these caravans typically used to hold enslaved humans, their cages are now more often filled with recently captured tigrans. Slaver Caravans are used both to capture the tigrans and to transport them to slaver auctions where they are sold off for a hefty profit. Slavers habitually hunt for tigrans in the open plains and forests, for those are the natural habitats of the tigrans."

#descr "The numerous and far-flung tribes of Musafir have long since accustomed themselves to a harsh, nomadic way of life, always moving from land to land, in search of better fortune and a permanent oasis to call their own. With a new god of the Harsh Sand on the rise and a loose alliance of the nomadic tribes on the brink of forming a nation under united leadership for the first time, the need to wander the desert has lessened. Even so, such an integral part of the Musafir culture cannot be changed overnight for even the very word Musafir means traveler.
Travelers are small nomadic tribes that migrate from land to land and typically consist of roughly a thousand people. As the various tribes of Musafir still harbor some small amounts of distrust against one another, no more than a single tribe, a single group of Travelers, will move from nor settle in a particular land at the same time.
Unlike the Travelers, the Traveler Caravans will also disassemble and pick up any presently located building into building blocks to be carried off with the caravan on numerous beasts of burden. Though such an undertaking requires many camels and is expensive, it is also often worth it. Traveler Caravans cannot be recruited in the City of Musafir for none would allow such an act."

With the blessing of their new god, many tribes, both small and large, take this opportunity to settle in these new and strange lands, and expand Musafir's influence. In the sacred City of Musafir, the biggest and oldest oasis in the harsh desert, many caravans are formed and then sent to claim distant lands and erect new Musafir settlements in the name of the Lord of the Harsh Sands. The numerous tribes constantly vie for power and the privilege to settle these rich lands, and as such whose caravan gets sent is heavily politically influenced as only one of the four major tribes is allowed to settle in any single land.

Travelers are small nomadic tribes that migrate from land to land and typically consist of roughly a thousand people.

In the sacred City of Musafir, the biggest and oldest oasis in the harsh desert, many caravans are formed and then sent to claim distant lands and erect new Musafir settlements in the name of the Lord of the Harsh Sands. The numerous tribes constantly vie for power and the privilege to settle these rich lands, and as such whose caravan gets sent is heavily politically influenced as only one of the four major tribes is allowed to settle in any single land.
This Tajir Caravan is currently in the process of settling down and erecting a primitive fortification and a temple."

#descr "The numerous and far-flung tribes of Musafir have long since accustomed themselves to a harsh, nomadic way of life, always moving from land to land, in search of better fortune and a permanent oasis to call their own. With a new god of the Harsh Sand on the rise and a loose alliance of the nomadic tribes on the brink of forming a nation under united leadership for the first time, the need to wander the desert has lessened. Even so, such an integral part of the Musafir culture cannot be changed overnight for even the very word Musafir means traveler.
Travelers are small nomadic tribes that migrate from land to land and typically consist of roughly a thousand people. As the various tribes of Musafir still harbor some small amounts of distrust against one another, no more than a single tribe, a single group of Travelers, will move from nor settle in a particular land at the same time.
Unlike the Travelers, the Traveler Caravans will also disassemble and pick up any presently located building into building blocks to be carried off with the caravan on numerous beasts of burden. Though such an undertaking requires many camels and is expensive, it is also often worth it. Traveler Caravans cannot be recruited in the City of Musafir for none would allow such an act."

#descr "The people of Musafir place great emphasis on the afterlife and regard the dead with great reverence. All those who die are burned and their ashes scattered across the plains of the dead, those of the harsh, sandy deserts of Musafir. The people of Musafir believe that they constantly travel between the two lands, of Life and Death, for if one stops and stays in the lifeless desert for too long, only Death will greet him. When a tribe perishes in the desert, it is often believed that they strayed too far in the lands of the dead and were claimed by them. The fact that such tribes are often laid to rest by Spirit Guides reinforces the belief.
It is the Spirit Guides that tend to the funerary rites of the people of Musafir. As the unyielding deserts of Musafir are considered holy and not of this world, only the Spirit Guides are allowed to spread the ashes of the decently cremated. Even though their roll in the tribal society of Musafir is essential, the burden of these spiritualists lies in being ostracized from the tribes, for men who stand between the two worlds belong to neither of them. Spirit Guides are only sought out to perform cremations and to carry the ashes to the spirit world."

It is said that these mystics can gaze into the desert flames and see great things yet to come. Much of their time is spent gazing into the flames of future. As they often live out as hermits; sequestered in the Harsh Sands of Musaifr, far from any tribal intrigue or politics, they do not hold as much priestly powers as the Soothsayers do. In times of great calamity and turbulence the Farseers will venture back into the tribes of Musafir and deliver the prophecies seen in the desert flames. Though the Farseers are known for their reclusive lifestyle, they do not always life alone. Often, traveling tribes that stray too close to a Farseers home will find themselves watched by the giant Golden Scorpions, implying that these mystics posses more power than they lead on to have. With the coming of the new Lord of the Harsh Sands, the Farseers have abandoned their hermitage and have started banding under a loose and scattered tribe of their own. Many now choose to serve these holy mystics that are foretelling the new dawn of Musafir under the Lord of the Harsh Sands."

Curious by nature, and somewhat whimsical, these spirits sometimes interact with the travelers of Musafir, whom they often observe in passing. Sylphs are almost immortal and can live for millennia.

An Envoy is a diplomatic head of mission with plenipotentiary powers to represent the interests of the Ministry. Besides having full authority when it comes to arranging favorable trade deals, the Envoys also act as spies and gather sensitive information which they then pass back to the Ministry through various caravans."

#name "Druid of the Grove"
#descr "The Druids of the Grove form an ancient order of priests of Nature who care for wildlife and perform ancient ceremonies to appease the spirits of the land. They are learned men of diverse fields of study, though all of them primarily study Nature magic.
In recent years the druidic orders have all but been wiped out by aggressive Ermorian campaigns to ban and destroy all spirit-based worship. It is only in Nemeton that the druids were given respite and protection by those same spirits of the land. Now the druids care and tend to the Sylvan groves, and in return the Sylvans extend their glamour to the druids, sheltering them from prying eyes, and eager swords.
While in forests, the Druids of the Grove can draw upon the knowledge of the land to gain insight into Nature magic."

#descr "Goblins vary wildly in habitat, appearance, and culture, but all are cruel, sneaky, cowardly, and disloyal. A typical Goblin divides his day between committing various malicious acts of thievery and backstabbing, denying their involvement in these acts, or sneaking off. Forest Goblins are a particular subgroup of Goblin that have their own culture, magic, and methods of warfare. They are particularly common in the South but can be found almost anywhere forest or jungle is dense enough to afford them shelter from other races from which they can raid. Forest Goblins, rather like Savage Orcs, arm themselves with primitive weapons of wood, stone, and bone, though truthfully these are hardly less effective than the metal weapons of their cousins. Forest Goblins wear little or no armour and decorate themselves with tattoos, warpaint, and bright feathers which they hammer directly into their skulls.

#descr "Goblins vary wildly in habitat, appearance, and culture, but all are cruel, sneaky, cowardly, and disloyal. A typical Goblin divides his day between committing various malicious acts of thievery and backstabbing, denying their involvement in these acts, or sneaking off. Forest Goblins are a particular subgroup of Goblin that have their own culture, language, and methods of warfare. They are particularly common in the South but can be found almost anywhere forest or jungle is dense enough to afford them shelter from other races from which they can raid. Forest Goblins, rather like Savage Orcs, arm themselves with primitive weapons of wood, stone, and bone, though truthfully these are hardly less effective than the metal weapons of their cousins. Forest Goblins wear little or no armour and decorate themselves with tattoos, warpaint, and bright feathers which they hammer directly into their skulls."

Spiders are eaten as food, milked for poison, kept as pets, and even worshipped as gods. Some of the larger species are also ridden into battle, where their ability to climb sheer surfaces and scitter over rough terrain and their venomous fangs and protective chitin are useful assets. In battle Spider Riders act as light cavalry, usually deployed on the flanks with either crude stone tipped lances or bows with poison dipped arrows.

#name "Goblin Archer"
#descr "Goblins vary wildly in habitat, appearance, and culture, but all are cruel, sneaky, cowardly, and disloyal. A typical Goblin divides his day between committing various malicious acts of thievery and backstabbing, denying their involvement in these acts, or sneaking off. Being physically weak the majority of Goblins hold a permanent position at the bottom of the Greenskin hierarchy, often ending up beaten, eaten, or otherwise mistreated both by the much larger Orcs and their own treacherous kin. Nonetheless since Goblins are ridiculously prolific, easy to boss around, and naturally inclined toward violence, they inevitably make up a large portion of Greenskin armies. Goblins are very keen on avoiding harm while still getting the chance to hurt other living beings and as such are quite fond of bows, with mobs of goblin archers capable of producing clouds of arrows deadly to unarmoured enemies. As these archers tend to stay back from the front lines their mobs are of little interest to the uniquely cruel Nasty Skulkers.

It is well known that Nightgoblins consume magic mushrooms, drink fungusbrew, and make use of the fungoid Squigs, but none outside their kind know exactly what the origin of Loonslime is. A strange purple substance which can induce hallucinations, paranoia, uncontrollable rage, and confusion when it makes contact with a living being, it is applied liberally to the weapons of the bizarre Nightgoblin sect known as the Loons. Loons go to battle wearing full metal helms fashioned into the aspect of the Bad Moon, a symbol they venerate, and are armoured under their robes with precious Dwarf chain links. Loons act as a kind of sacred shock infantry for the Nightgoblins, being much better trained and fiercer warriors than any other of their kind. Even Orcs treat them with a similar form of the pained respect they grant to Shamans, as no sane being would wish to be spiked with Loonslime.

In temperament Nightgoblins are even more distrustful, sneaky, and cowardly than a typical Goblin, but tend to have better reflexes, honed by a life of sudden death at the teeth and claws of unspeakable cave beasts. Despite their relative weakness, Nightgoblin mobs are feared in battle because they may be hiding a Fanatic, a crazed loon pumped up on strength enhancing magic mushrooms and armed with a massive iron ball and chain. Nightgoblin infantry overwhelmingly favour the spear both as a good tunnel fighting weapon and a way of stabbing their foes from a safer distance.

Goblins are more prolific, but it is the Orcs are most associated with the Greenskin species and do the bulk of the bloody work of battle. Orcs are a warrior race and like little more than a good scrap, so this suits them just fine. In fact Orcs so enjoy fighting that when lacking enemies they will happily brawl amongst themselves. Fortunately they are an incredibly resilient race, barely registering pain and blessed with the ability to regrow entire missing limbs if given time. Though they stand a little shorter than a human, Orcs are very broad and well muscled, which suits their headlong charges and brawling style of battle. Orcs are infamous for the crude but deadly 'choppas' they fashion, which they are able to swing with devastating force on the charge. Orc equipment tends to vary greatly depending on available loot, wealth of their tribe, and their ability to win better gear from their fellow orcs in headbutting contests.

#descr "Orc hierarchy is a straightforward matter - the biggest and the best at fighting will rise toward the top. In fact those who begin their ascent through the ranks of a mob will actually become bigger in response to the elevated social status, growing thicker bone and muscle, becoming stronger and more aggressive, and developing impressive tusks. Any Orc large and fighty enough to distinguish himself from the bulk of the Boyz in the tribe is known as a Bigun and will have a greater share of the loot and the glory in any battle. Savage Orcs are no exception to this, though on the whole they have far less interest in loot and their Bigun mobs eschew armour and metal weapons just as the Boyz do. This Bigun is armed with a hefty two handed axe made of wood with a sharpened stone head."

#descr "Amongst the primitive Savage Orc tribes of the south those marked out with the potential to become Shamans, usually by greenish light leaking from their eyes, are far more common than in the north. However many of these Savage Orcs, while clearly touched by Mork and or Gork, never develop further magical powers or descend into the truly odd and 'unorcish' behaviour of the Shamans. Instead they remain wild and aggressive fighters like their fellows, though their eyes still glow and their warpaint is especially effective. Waaaghboys, as they are known amongst their kind, are considered sacred to the Greenskins.

Driven to new heights of fury by the unexpected rider, the Cave Squig responded by bouncing around with unflagging enthusiasm, much to the delight of the cackling and whooping onlookers. Although the incident ended with both Squig and rider impaled on a wickedly sharp stalagtite, the experience was enough to inspire the other Herdas present and a new craze was born. Squig Hoppas are mad in the particular way that some Nightgoblins tend to be and, especially given their horrendous casualty rate, not terribly common. When enough can be mustered by a tribe they generally prove very effective as a sort of bizarre frenetic cavalry capable of inflicting serious damage on even well armoured enemies. Should the rider be slain the Squig will continue to fight, though it will doubtless bound away after the battle.

The secret to their incredible strength and mindless devotion to spinning death and destruction is the potent magic mushroom brew they are fed before battle.

#descr "Long ago many Goblins took up abode in the caves beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains. Over time they adapted to their new home and became a distinct type, known as Nightgoblins. They are not dissimilar to their surface dwelling cousins, though they have better night vision and wear dark hooded robes to shelter from the painfully bright sun. In temperament Nightgoblins are even more distrustful, sneaky, and cowardly than a typical Goblin, but tend to have better reflexes, honed by a life of sudden death at the teeth and claws of unspeakable cave beasts. Despite their relative weakness, Nightgoblin mobs are feared in battle because they may be hiding a Fanatic, a crazed loon pumped up on strength enhancing magic mushrooms and armed with a massive iron ball and chain. Nightgoblin infantry overwhelmingly favour the spear both as a good tunnel fighting weapon and a way of stabbing their foes from a safer distance."

As Arrer Boyz can prove their prowess in combat, such oddities can be overlooked. Yelling rude names at Arrer Boyz is a proven way to alleviate camp boredom as the resulting response in the form of a hail of arrows is typically good for starting a big ruckus. Orcs are generally poor shots being both somewhat shortsighted and lacking the patience to aim for long before loosing their arrow, but their bows, though crude, are large and powerful. There is also something to be said for, at the end of the day, being a hulking Orc entirely capable in melee combat when the arrows run out or the enemy reaches their mob.

In fact Savage Orc Arrer Boyz tend to be better shots than their northern counterparts, as their magical warpaint enhances their senses in battle. Being Savage Orcs though, they are quick to hurl aside their bows and charge into melee if provoked into a battle frenzy.

#name "Nightgoblin Squig Herda Team"
#descr "Cave Squigs are found in the bowels of the earth, common in the caverns deep beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains. They are improbable creatures, part animal and part fungus with spheroid bodies, beady eyes, and huge gaping maws filled with razor sharp teeth. Nightgoblins hunt Squigs of all types for various purposes, but the common Cave Squig is primarily used as a living weapon in battle. Once they have been captured by Nettas and beaten into a daze by Clubbas, Cave Squigs are forced into underground stockades and trained by Nightgoblin Herdas, as much as is even possible, to go where directed by the jabs of a long three pronged 'prodda'. Such is the concentration and constant prodding that is required that a team of two Nightgoblin Herdas carrying their oversized prodda can only reliably usher a pair of Cave Squigs toward the enemy, but then again two Squigs can do a lot of damage very quickly indeed. Should the Squigs be slain in battle the Herdas, if they survive, can always fetch more from the stockade, as in reality the 'training' is much more teaching the Nightgoblins how to keep the Squig from eating them than it is in any way changing the behaviour of the Squig.

#name "Stone Troll"
#descr "Trolls are hulking creatures whose hunched appearance belies their powerful nature. These dim witted creatures are eternally hungry and will consume almost anything from rocks and plants to metal or flesh. Not surprisingly their stomachs contain extremely powerful acids which they are known to spontaneously vomit at prey in lieu of beating it to a pulp with a crude club or tearing it apart with their long claws. Trolls are incredibly strong and, though they are quite slow and uncoordinated, truly deadly opponents in battle, but their greatest strength is their ability to regenerate. Trolls can heal any wound entirely in short order and even in the course of seconds or minutes their flesh will knit back together, making the task of killing them very difficult. Stone Trolls, the most common variety of Troll in the North and East of the Old World, have developed both tough protective hides and a resistance to magic. Without the help of Shamanic rituals Stone Trolls can only be found in cave systems and it is fairly rare for the Greenskins to be able to get them to join their armies. On the plus side Stone Trolls are too stupid to require any payment beyond food.

Their name stems from their dark green skin, though it also fits their dour demeaner, for while they are as aggressive and unreasonable as other Orcs, they are grimly and singularly focused on war. Indeed they take war so seriously that they regard even elite formations such as Boar Boy Biguns as frivolous amateurs. Being the best fighters in any Greenskin army, Black Orcs usually end up with the lion's share of loot and pride themselves on meticulously maintaining both heavy armour and quality weapons, something other Greenskins mock when out of earshot. The origins of the Black Orcs are a mystery, but one common tale is they were created by the Chaos Dwarfs as battle slaves and nearly doomed that empire when they inevitably revolted. Black Orcs wade into battle either with a choppa and heavy shield, a massive two handed big choppa, or lighter armour and paired choppas."

Their name stems from their dark green skin, though it also fits their dour demeaner, for while they are as aggressive and unreasonable as other Orcs, they are grimly and singularly focused on war. Indeed they take war so seriously that they regard even elite formations such as Boar Boy Biguns as frivolous amateurs. Being the best fighters in any Greenskin army, Black Orcs usually end up with the lion's share of loot and pride themselves on meticulously maintaining both heavy armour and quality weapons, something other Greenskins mock when out of earshot. The origins of the Black Orcs are a mystery, but one common tale is they were created by the Chaos Dwarfs as battle slaves and nearly doomed that empire when they inevitably revolted. Black Orcs wade into battle either with a choppa and heavy shield, a massive two handed big choppa, or lighter armour and paired choppas."

#descr "Orc chariots arent quite as well constructed or maintained as their Goblin counterparts, but there is no denying their effectiveness. Pulled by two extremely angry War Boars, these crude war machines can pick up quite a pace and have sufficient mass to simply smash through enemy formations. While wolves are certainly faster, the strength and energy of one charging War Boar, let alone two, is something to behold. It takes a certain type of Orc to  willingly crew such a contraption and while they are respected by their peers for the carnage they can inflict, they are regarded as being 'not all there in da 'ead', a view exacerbated by their use of suspiciously spearlike long-handled Choppas.

#descr "Orc hierarchy is a straightforward matter - the biggest and the best at fighting will rise toward the top. In fact those who begin their ascent through the ranks of a mob will actually become bigger in response to the elevated social status, growing thicker bone and muscle, becoming stronger and more aggressive, and developing impressive tusks. Any Orc large and fighty enough to distinguish himself from the bulk of the Boyz in the tribe is known as a Bigun and will have a greater share of the loot and the glory in any battle. Biguns therefore tend to be better equipped, with some carrying a pair of choppas or a massive two handed 'big choppa' into battle.

Whether capturing them for food or as beasts of war, Nightgoblins make extensive use of both strong nets woven from cavespider silk to halt their foe and large cavewood clubs to brutally subdue them.

#descr "At a distance you could mistake a Wyvern for a Dragon, but there is no nobility of spirit in these brutal beasts. Wyverns are apex predators that live high in the barren reaches of the World's Edge Mountains, although they will range far from their bone strewn lairs to devastate villages and farms. When Greenskins see the menacing silhouette of a Wyvern circling high above they greet it with whoops and cheers, for an instinctual kinship is felt between these destructive beings, and Orcs see Wyverns as manifestations of the proper order of the strong imposing their will on the weak. No Orc would be so stupid as to think they could tame an adult Wyvern through force, but Shamans have passed down rituals to call and bind them to the Greenskin cause for generations and occasionally Nightgoblins will steal Wyvern eggs and sell them to powerful Orc leaders to raise from hatchlings as personal mounts. Wyverns cannot breathe fire like Dragons, but are incredibly strong and protected by layers of thick scales, as well as having a lightning fast poison stinger at the tip of their tail."

#name "Goblin Wolf Rider Scout"
#descr "Perhaps it is their mutual instincts to pick on the helpless or the isolated but, for whatever reason, there has always been a strong bond between Goblins and the giant wolves that plague the Northeast of the Old World. The two creatures recognised in each other an ally, albeit a fierce one, that was apt to remain loyal only while times were good. As such Goblins have ridden wolves in the manner men or elves ride horses for hundreds of years. Goblin Wolf Riders are dangerously fast and, though they should not be expected to do well in prolonged melee, they are quite capable of slaughtering vulnerable targets or encircling the flanks of more powerful foes. They are experts at riding in close pack formation, a great aid in overwhelming their prey. Wolfriders arm themselves with spears, light lances, and bows. Even armies with no packs of Wolfriders will usually employ a few lone scouts to range ahead and report back to the boss.

They are also considerably less prone to acting in an 'eccentric' manner, though even if this weren't the case no Orc expects 'propa' behaviour out of a Goblin anyway. That said, Goblin Shamans are afforded a similar level of respect by almost any Orc, as they are notoriously spiteful and vengeful creates, just as happy to turn their unpleasant magic on a disrespectful tribe member as the enemy. Amongst their own kind Goblin Shamans hold considerable status and their council is often saught to resolve disputes (usually in their own favour), ward off bad magic, and the like. Goblin Shamans do not have the priestly authority of their Orcish counterparts and are better able to tolerate the boredom of research.

It is the Shamans who extract venom from captured spiders for use in warfare, recreation, and typical Goblin scheming. Forest Goblin Shamans are less willing to perform research than other types of Goblin Shaman, but their connection with nature grants them slightly more magical power. Though they are certainly important to the tribe they are perhaps a little too common for their own good and are not invested with any priestly authority, unlike their elder or Orcish counterparts. Forest Goblin Shamans carry ceremonial wands tipped with venomous spider fangs.

Because of the vast quantities they consume they are, if anything, even more prone to abject insanity than Orc Shamans. When a Nightgoblin Shaman is in the grips of mania, far from ignoring them like Orcs with their Shamans, their fellow Nightgoblins instead revel and share in theirs frenzied state, gulping down large quantities of distilled fungus brew. Strangely Nightgoblin Shamans are the best equipped to cope with the task of research, as their frequently altered mental state does bring bursts of magical enlightenment.

Amongst the Nightgoblins their is no higher status than that of Great Shaman and it is said even Skarsnik, the most famous Nightgoblin Warboss to ever live, would not dare cross one. It is the Great Shamans that preside over the gatherings of Nightgoblin tribes to share in vast cauldrons of fungus brew, it is they who divine the location of Great Cave Squigs to hunt, and it is they who select those who will receive the Madcap mushroom blessing and become Fanatics. In addition to their advanced magical powers, Nightgoblin Great Shamans consume so many magic mushrooms that they can at times speak the will of Mork and Gork directly and so have considerable priestly authority. Indeed they train tiny Squiggly Beasts to follow them around with a bowl of mushrooms they can feast on at any moment. It goes without saying that these habits result in extremely frequent bouts of complete insanity.

While Shamans are powerful assets to a tribe and fulfil many vital roles within what passes for Greenskin culture, every Orc knows there's just something 'not right in the ead' about them. Indeed outright madness seems to be a consequence of the constant surges of energy flowing through their minds. It is a common occurence to find an Orc Shaman leaping around howling and behaving an an extremely un-Orcish manner while battle-hardened Biguns and even Warbosses stoically and respectfully pretend not to notice. Orc Shamans focus on darker and more destructive magic than their Goblin counterparts but are even less interested in conducting research.

Instead they are a more integral part of the tribe's crude culture and take part in social rituals where they apply and bless the warpaint and tattoos of the Boyz to protect them in battle. As such they are less prone to fits of insanity and better able to channel the enthusiastic energy of their tribe into raw elemental power. That said, they are even less interested in conducting research, and activity they see as almost entirely unorcish.

Though far less numerous than lesser Shamans, they are a more common sight than the Great Shamans of Orc or Nightgoblin society as they rise from the much larger Goblin population and are less prone to die from mushroom overdose than their cave dwelling cousins. Goblin Great Shamans adorn themselves with bone and horn taken from great beasts, Trolls, or even Giants felled by their tribe and these bestial fetishes help focus and manage the raw magical energy that courses through them. As such they are barely prone to madness or suddenly exploding at all. On the other hand their magical power is quite variable - Goblins will happily describe any Shaman that shows more power than the typical small tribe mystic as a Great Shaman. Goblin Great Shamans have a degree of priestly authority and are better able to tolerate the boredom of research than their Orcish counterparts.

#name "Orc Boss"
#descr "Orcs are led by the biggest and brawniest of their kind. These hulking individuals have risen up from the ranks of the Biguns and pummeled their way to the top, defeating the previous Boss in a one-on-one fight and quite possibly killing him. Unlike Goblin Bosses who are defined both by their cunning and knack for doing violence, Orc Bosses got where they are by doing what Orcs love best with little thought to strategy or tactics. That said, a large and violent Orc exerts a natural leadership over his fellows and any who don't follow his typically quite simple orders will catch a stupendous beating. Being the biggest, best, and fightiest Orc Bosses tend to have good quality wargear. While there are Orc Bosses who ascend to no higher station each and every one of them is driven by instinct to try and become a Big Boss and eventually a Warboss, through a simple and proven method - constant warfare. Merely fighting amongst the tribe is not enough, any Boss can do that, it is against the many enemy races which populate the world that a Boss must prove himself to climb the ladder.

#descr "While Bosses and Big Bosses are fundamentally the same size and toughness of Orc, just with a different hierarchical status, Warbosses are truly in a class of their own. As a Big Boss rises to the level of a Warboss he packs on more and more muscle and grows larger and larger, to the point that he towers over his subordinates. Warbosses lead entire tribes, sometimes even multiple tribes, and typically have a core mob of Biguns that act as their enforcers. While Savage Orcs eschew the gathering of metal arms and armour, a Savage Orc Warboss will adorn himself with equipment made from the bones of particularly savage conquests and draw upon their ferocity in battle. Additionally they will have their pick of the best War Boar stock and as such will ride even larger and more ferocious mounts than their more civilised cousins. From the postion of Warboss there is only one further goal for any Greenskin, to fight and win until they trigger a Waaagh, a covergence of surging energy, enthusiasm for violence, and sheer number of Greenskins that threatens to sweep away entire civilisations."

As such, Goblin Bosses tend to be a combination of vicious, lucky, and smart. Goblin tribes are by far the most numerous, inhabiting and thriving in almost every part of the known world, partly because they are capable of operating at a much lower profile than larger mixed Greenskin hosts or Orc tribes. Each of these tribes, even the smallest, will invariably have numerous Goblin Bosses actively engaged in a deadly game of cunning, violence, and treachery against each other. No matter how much they might scheme though, the path upward to Big Boss, then Warboss, is the same no matter what type of Greenskin - it must be earned through battle.

Rather than becoming a Boss through a combination of cunning, luck, cruelty, and violence, Forest Goblin Bosses are determined by the Shamans of the tribe. The rituals used to select a new Boss do vary between different Forest Goblin tribes but almost all involve liberal use of spider venom to test promising candidates and determine which have the favour of the local spider god. That said, the Shamans ensure that only most cunning, lucky, and violent candidates actually pass the trial by poison, so Forest Goblin bosses are no less dangerous than those of other tribes. Once a goblin has become a Boss he may only climb the hierarchy to the position of Big Boss through participation in battle.

That said, the Shamans ensure that only most cunning, lucky, and violent candidates actually pass the trial by poison, so Forest Goblin bosses are no less dangerous than those of other tribes. Once a goblin has become a Boss he may only climb the hierarchy to the position of Big Boss through participation in battle."

Goblins cannot hope to match the physical prowess of Orcs and as such tend to lead tribes of Goblins, but Warbosses can often get even Orc Big Bosses to do their bidding through careful manipulation and a willingness to resort to foul play. As such a Goblin Warboss may be at the head of a considerable and dangerous army where their cunning makes them formidable leaders. A Goblin of such status needs to display his superiority and as such Goblin Warbosses travel everywhere on stylish red chariots drawn by slavering wolves. From the postion of Warboss there is only one further goal for any Greenskin, to fight and win until they trigger a Waaagh, a covergence of surging energy, enthusiasm for violence, and sheer number of Greenskins that threatens to sweep away entire civilisations."

#descr "Orcs determine their hierarchy in a simple manner - the biggest and the best fighter takes control. Goblins of all types follow a less straightforward path to the top ranks, as they are both weaker and more devious than their larger cousins. Although straight up fighting is always an option and it helps to be bigger than your fellows, rank is primarily gained through underhanded tactics and sheer cunning. As such, Goblin Bosses tend to be a combination of vicious, lucky, and smart. Amongst Nightgoblins in particular it helps to have the support of a Shaman and have amassed significant personal wealth in the form of stolen Dwarven chain mail links, a popular currency and a highly prized component in armour. Having become a Boss, though, the path upward to Big Boss, then Warboss, is the same no matter what type of Greenskin - it must be earned through battle.

Grokka even shuns the use of a boar to ride into battle, preferring to fight from foot with his pair of crude stone axes and rely on his toughness, skill, and sheer berserk fury to carry him through to victory. This approach has garnered much admiration from other Savage Orcs and it is said that Grokka may be a personification of the fighting fury of the Orc deity Gork, though the Shamans are waiting for Grokka to form a true Waaagh before agreeing this is the case."

#descr "Grokka Goreaxe is a Savage Orc Warboss who epitomises the Savage Orc belief that things should be kept simple and Orcs should live as they once did, as berserk primal forces of rage and violence unencumbered by metal weapons, armour, plans, or even language. Grokka even shuns the use of a boar to ride into battle, preferring to fight from foot with his pair of crude stone axes and rely on his toughness, skill, and sheer berserk fury to carry him through to victory. This approach has garnered much admiration from other Savage Orcs and it is said that Grokka may be a personification of the fighting fury of the Orc deity Gork, though the Shamans are waiting for Grokka to form a true Waaagh before agreeing this is the case."

#name "Great Green Prophet"
#descr "Wurrzag Ud Ura Zahubu is a Savage Orc Shaman of mighty mystical powers. Known as Da Great Green Prophet, he is recognised to be on a mission from Gork and Mork to advance the cause of all greenskin kind and is famed for turning around the fortunes of once great tribes. It is said that he inspired the Bone Nose tribe to conquer great swathes of the Southlands, sent the Iron Pig tribe rampaging through the Border Princes, and saved the Spotted Skullz from near certain destruction at the hands of an undead legion. Wurrzag always seeks to find the very strongest Bosses and Warbosses and elevate them to perhaps one day lead their own Waaagh, for his insights into gaining the favour of Gork and Mork are legendary. Unlike other Shaman Wurrzag is never distracted from his crusade and though he is clearly touched by the divine he is surprisingly lucid and orcish by the estimations of other greenskins, which itself is somewhat unnerving. In battle Wurrzag rides his mighty boar Spleenrippa and brandishes a magical staff atop which sits his his squiggly beast, in reality the former Great Shaman of the Bone Nose tribe transformed by Wurrzag in a brief magical duel, and from which Wurrzag can draw constant energy. Befitting his station Da Great Green Prophet wears at all times the famed Baleful Mask, a crude wooden construct which constantly sears the minds of his foes as his gaze passes across the them."

#descr "Gobbos are cowardly and disloyal, but nothing stirs their wicked hearts like Grom, mightiest of Goblin Warbosses. Grom was once a fairly ordinary, if perhaps unusually aggressive, Goblin Boss in the Broken Axe tribe, but everything changed when he consumed, upon a dare, a mass of raw Troll flesh. As Troll flesh regenerates and Grom, always a big eater, had not stopped to cook the meal, this appeared to be a suicidal course of action. Yet Grom did not perish, even as the foul meat writhed and thrashed in his belly, and a race between his ability to digest and the flesh's ability to regrow began in earnest. After a full day and night of terrible pain, Grom emerged from his tent a changed Goblin - grown to prodigious size, granted great strength, and able to regenerate his own wounds even more quickly than a Troll. Unsurprisingly Grom soon became Warboss of his own tribe, then conquered the surrounding tribes, personally slaying several Orc Warbosses who severely underestimated this massive Goblin. To Goblins Grom was now a living God, for he was everything they were not, and he strived to live up to his legend, setting his sights overseas on the Elven land of Ulthuan to prove his kind could overcome their ancestral fear of the 'pointy ears'. Grom rides into battle atop his custom War Chariot, armed with his infamous axe Elfbiter, and engenders surprising courage and fervour in his followers, the bulk of which are always Goblins. As a legendary Warboss, Grom may trigger a vast Waaagh in his name by engaging in battle."

#name "Slaughterer"
#descr "Azhag the Slaughterer is a Warboss like no other before him, a union of the brawn and power of an Orc in his prime and the malevolent intelligence of an ancient evil. Azhag was once Boss of a small band of Orcs struggling to survive in the frozen North, but everything changed when he discovered a magic crown in the ruins of a long-forgotten city. The crown whispered fell plans to Azhag and the Orc took to wearing it always, finding success after success as a result of following its machinations. Always the crown spoke of further triumphs, greater ambitions, and Azhag sought them willingly. Though he was prone to use unorcish words, had little tolerance for the typical infighting of his kind, and seemed to be 'not quite right in da 'ead', Greenskins flocked to his banner. As he grew in power the demands of the crown increased though, as it cajoled and manipulated him Southward, seeking to reunite with its original owner. Possessing a brutish and stubborn mind, the Warboss would often resist, standing still in a stupor while battling internally for control of his actions. The only time the two minds work entirely in conjunction is during battle, as Azhag's instincts for violence perfectly complement both the crown's clever plans and the destructive sorcery it granted to its hulking host. In battle Azhag rides atop his personal War Wyvern Skullmuncha and in addition to the dread crown equips himself with magical blades and charmed armour. Though highly unusual, Azhag is nonetheless an Orc Warboss in his prime and may trigger a great Waaagh by engaging in battle."

When Greenskins see the menacing silhouette of a Wyvern circling high above they greet it with whoops and cheers, for an instinctual kinship is felt between these destructive beings, and Orcs see Wyverns as manifestations of the proper order of the strong imposing their will on the weak. No Orc would be so stupid as to think they could tame an adult Wyvern through force, but occasionally Nightgoblins will steal Wyvern eggs and sell them to powerful Orc leaders to raise from hatchlings as personal mounts. This Orc Warboss has such a mount and the pair make for a force of sheer destruction on the battlefield.

Gorfang's rule over the western entrance to Death Pass is absolute and he has smartly formed an alliance with the Night Goblins of Karak Eight Peaks, led by the infamously cunning Skarsnik. Gorfang has spent most of his life fighting Dwarfs, losing an eye at the Battle of the Jaws and hammering an iron patch into the socket to commemorate the fight rather than letting it heal. Gorfang's most notorious success against the stunties came in the attack on Karak Azul, during which he broke into Lord Kazador's throne room and captured many of the Dwarf Lord's kinsfolk. The Dwarf Lord's son, Kazrik, was not taken captive but was shaved, tattooed with Gorfang's personal glyph and firmly nailed to Kazador's own throne. Kazrik survived, but Lord Kazador has sworn an undying grudge against the Red Fangs. In battle Gorfang wields the massive serrated choppa Red Fang with incredible speed and is protected by a huge shield cut from the great doors of Karak Azul and the magical Evil Sun Armour. As with any Warboss, Gorfang may trigger a Waaagh in his name through regularly joining battle."

While the Warriors of Khorne temper their rage with discipline even in battle, the Chosen are true berserkers who give their lives wholly to the expression of rage and bloodlust. It is said that the Chosen of Khorne will fight on despite horrendous wounds and in the face of impossible odds, for even should their sheer fury falter somehow, they would never willingly dishonour Khorne by taking a backward step. The Chosen have reached the end of their path, never destined to rise toward the ultimate goal of Daemonhood, but their souls will surely receive lavish attention from Khorne in death just as they have in life. The Chosen are sacred to the followers of the Blood God.

While in combat they are a strange mix of cold discipline and boiling rage, but their professionalism and dedication to martial matters are unquestionable, for Khorne has none of the indulgent traits or Slaanesh or Nurgle. Those Warriors who acheive great deeds in battle will attract the attention of Khorne and may become Chosen in the eyes of the Blood God, though Khorne is an exacting master and may also find them lacking and curse them to become Forsaken or even Chaos Spawn.

The Chosen Knights of Khorne, in particular, are perhaps the most deadly heavy cavalry in existence, for they ride not mighty Chaos Steeds but instead near unstoppable Daemonic mounts known as Juggernauts. These mounts are beasts of brass and iron and pure Daemonic hatred and are capable of crushing, tearing, and obliterating almost anything in their path, though they are somewhat kept in check by their riders, for the Chosen Knights of Khorne do not enter the berserk killing frenzy of their kindred and are instead an implacable force of steely hatred. Should the rider be slain the Juggernaut will fight on for the rest of the battle before returning to the Realm of Khorne. Being Chosen of Khorne they are sacred to the followers of the Blood God.

They are rarely encountered alone, instead being the preferred steeds of Chosen Knights, Chaos Lords, and Bloodletter Daemons.

While they are typically quite resistant to both the warping taint of Chaos and the tempting whispers of the Dark Prince, they are naturally drawn to promises of excess and violence and so can often be found in the forces of Khorne. Even fairly small Marauder forces can occasionally find themselves benefitting from the presence of a handful of Ogres because these creatures are natural opportunists and recognise that in a smaller force they can bully their way to getting a larger share of the loot. Chaos Ogres have, despite their natural resistances, been changed by their exposure to Chaos and the attentions of the Ruinous Powers and are even stronger and more ferocious fighters than their former fellows in the Ogre Kingdoms.

The Exalted are monstrously powerful combatants capable of commanding forces of the mightiest warriors in the world, blessed many times over by their patron God and with an iron will to pursue their ambitions and become immortal. They are to the Aspiring Champions as the Chosen are to the Warriors, but unlike the Chosen they do not accept they have reached the zenith of their journey, for the prize of becoming a Chaos Lord and eventually a Daemon Prince still lies ahead of them and the risk of being reduced to a gibbering Chaos Spawn is one they gladly accept. Exalted Heroes of Khorne are berserker warriors of towering rage and violence that live for battle, having set aside all other concerns in an effort to draw Khorne's favour and attain the title of Chaos Lord. They wield an axe of Daemonic brass and a blade which snarls and tears at the foe as it bites into their flesh. Khorne has a great hatred for those who would cower behind walls of stone rather than do battle and as such his Exalted have an innate understanding of how to break into besieged fortifications.
[Requires friendly Dominion strength of 7 in the province to recruit]

#name "Exalted Hero"
#descr "Exalted Heroes stand as paragons on the Path of the Warrior and the Champion, for they are everything that every Chaos Warrior and Aspiring Champion strives to be. The Exalted are monstrously powerful combatants capable of commanding forces of the mightiest warriors in the world, blessed many times over by their patron God and with an iron will to pursue their ambitions and become immortal. They are to the Aspiring Champions as the Chosen are to the Warriors, but unlike the Chosen they do not accept they have reached the zenith of their journey, for the prize of becoming a Chaos Lord and eventually a Daemon Prince still lies ahead of them and the risk of being reduced to a gibbering Chaos Spawn is one they gladly accept. Exalted Heroes of Khorne are berserker warriors of towering rage and violence that live for battle, having set aside all other concerns in an effort to draw Khorne's favour and attain the title of Chaos Lord. They wield an axe of Daemonic brass and a blade which snarls and tears at the foe as it bites into their flesh. Khorne has a great hatred for those who would cower behind walls of stone rather than do battle and as such his Exalted have an innate understanding of how to break into besieged fortifications.
[This Exalted Hero is awaiting the event that will transform them to either a Chaos Lord (and losing all its XP) or a mindless Chaos Spawn]

Chaos Lords are extremely skilled combatants and physically far beyond the potential of mortal men in addition to being experienced and innately talented commanders. They are granted Daemonic mounts to carry them into battle and emphasize their status; in the case of Khorne a roaring, snorting, crushingly powerful beast of brass and iron called a Juggernaut. Should the Chaos Lord be slain, this mount will fight on before returning to the Chaos Realm of Khorne. Aside from continuing to butcher worthy foes and spill blood for the Blood God, all that remains for this Chaos Lord is to prove themselves so fully that they are elevated to immortality in the form of a Daemon Prince. Chaos Lords of Khorne are starkly different from the lesser Exalted Heroes, having sufficiently immersed themselves in rage and bloodlust that they have forge a harder more disciplined fury, replacing their frenzy with a will of steel and boundless ambition. Khorne has a great hatred for those who would cower behind walls of stone rather than do battle and as such his Lords have an innate understanding of how to break into besieged fortifications.
[When this Chaos Lord is promoted it will transform to a form which will then be further transformed by an event, either finally becoming a Daemon Prince (and losing all its XP) or being turned into a mindless Chaos Spawn]

They are rarely encountered alone, instead being the preferred steeds of Chosen Knights, Chaos Lords, and Bloodletter Daemons. As Daemons of Khorne they are highly resistant both to subtle hostile magic and to physical attacks.

#name "Marauder Shaman"
#descr "Most Marauder tribes will have one or two Shamans whose duty is to offer counsel to the Chieftain, interpret auguries to ensure successful raids, and lead the tribe in offering the proper observances to their patron God. Shamans tend to have only a little magical talent and rather than harnessing energy provided by the Ruinous Powers, they tap into the magic of their surroundings in the manner of hedge mages, witches, and other lesser mages. Shamans thus practice a different branch of magic from Sorcerers focused on veneration of the dead, the wilds, and the bitter cold of the polar lands. Shamans of Marauder tribes dedicated to Khorne in the guise of the Hound have a lower status than those of other tribes as Khorne is highly distrustful of magic users and carry a spear rather than a staff, for they are more willing warriors than others of their kind. They use magic of the wilds, frost, bone, and rock.

#descr "Even so called scholars of the Ruinous Powers are prone to mistake their natures as singular or unchangeable, believing Khorne is a create of slaughter, Slaanesh depravity, Nurgle decay, and Tzeentch sorcery. But in truth each of the Chaos Gods contains multitudes of aspects that contrast, compete, compliment, clash, and contradict each other in a constant impossible whirl of meaning. So it is that Khorne is the God of raging berserkers, keen tacticians, and honourable duelists all, but Khorne has aspect beyonds these too; the Blood God also favours smiths, the heat of the forge, and the discipline of the ascetic. The Disciples of Brass worship this last aspect of Khorne, a discipline and purity of form they see in Khorne's proclivity for gleaming brass. Though they train their bodies extensively the Disciples are not strictly warriors and though they are magically talented their use of the magic of Brass, of fire and earth and metal, could never be considered sorcery. They are monks of a kind, recruiting from members of the Marauder tribes who dream of an endless unspoiled realm of brass that lies within, and though they are not sacred to the followers of Khorne, they are treated with a wary respect.

Most who are chained in such a way die, thrashing and screaming until the very last, howling their endless rage at the sky, but a small handful manage to somehow control their bloodlust through strength of will. Those who survive this ordeal are selected by Khorne to be trained as Ragesmiths, the tireless smiths of daemonic arms and armour that worship Khorne's aspect as the lord of the fiery forge. Ragesmiths are truly gifted in the creation of magical items, letting Khorne's infinite knowledge of tools of slaughter and war flow through them and their great depth of rage guide their hammer on the Brass Anvil they were once bound to. Should a Ragesmith enter battle they will be unable to contain their rage and will immediately enter a berserk frenzy, hurling themselves into the enemy lines. Ragesmiths are recognised to be favoured by Khorne and are sacred to the followers of the Blood God.

These demagogues are known to drink the blood of the enemy spilled in battle and it is said that every drop that passes their lips is added to the great moat of blood surrounding Khorne's citadel of brass. Whether or not this is true, the consumption of this blood marks great physical changes in the Slaughterpriests, who tower over even hulking Chaos Warriors and whose muscle and bone have grown great and hard like stone and corded steel. Slaughterpriests are capable of performing incantations to deliver Khorne's gifts in battle and are known to perform blood rituals and seek out worthy sacrifices in the short times they spend away from the direct pursuit of war.

Khorne has a deep contempt for sorcery and Bloodthirsters use no magic save their daemonic armaments, though they are of Khorne's essence and may act as powerful priests in the Blood God's cause. Each is armed with a great burning axe to strike down single targets and a fiery whip with which to destroy ranks of massed enemies. As with all Daemons they are more powerful within the Dominion of their God and, as Greater Daemons, they are capable of reforming their body should they be slain in this Dominion."

#name "Exiled One"
#descr "Skarbrand was once the mightiest and most favoured of Khorne's Bloodthirsters and the highest general amongst the Greater Daemons of the Blood God. It was Skarbrand who smashed the first palace of the youngest God Slaanesh, Skarbrand who slew the feared Lord of Change known as Tleth'krr, and Skarbrand who led the Eight Hosts of Murder to defeat the combined forces of all three rival Ruinous Powers. So did Skarbrand sit high in Khorne's esteem, and so did Skarbrand's pride grow until he foolishly tried to challenge the Blood God, suddenly striking his master with all his might. Khorne's great brass armour was barely scratched by the blow, but his rage was terrible to behold. Skarbrand was cast from the highest tower of the Brass Citadel and cursed with the total destruction of his once great mind and boundless ambition, instead becoming an unthinking avatar of rage doomed to gather skulls for Khorne in permanent exile. Skarbrand exists in a constant state of berserker rage and his very presence on the battlefield causes others to enter a similar state, as his madness and rage spreads. Skarbrand long ago discarded his whip in favour of a searing blade known as Carnage and in battle enters such a towering rage that he does not fly, instead charging headlong forward, wings forgotten. As a true exile Skarbrand is unlike other Bloodthirsters and does not grow weaker outside the Dominion of his master, nor will he be able to reform if slain in battle. Though Skarbrand is forever banished from Khorne's favour, his failed coup and subsequent rage is a stark reminder of the Blood God's power and he is both considered sacred and spreads the Dominion of the followers of Khorne."

#name "Bloodbeast"
#descr "Scylla Anfingrimm, known also as the Bloodbeast, was once a mighty Chaos Lord of Khorne, perhaps the greatest of his time. In his former life, he was nigh-invincible and unmatched in battle, having slain some of the fiercest beasts and armies in service to his God and raided the coastlines from frozen Norsca to exotic Ind. No other had so quickly climbed the ranks of the Blood God's esteem and many amongst his tribe, the vicious warriors of the Ironpelt, had boldly claimed that it would not be long until their ruler was visited by Khorne with the greatest gift of Daemonhood. In a sense, they were right. It was when Scyla had single-handedly slaughtered the bestial Gorgers of Undermountain, only the latest in a long litany of mighty and unimaginably violent deeds, that he was granted his final boon. But so passionate was Scylla for the gifts of the Blood God that this mutation, in addition to the multitudes he already possessed, proved too much for his mortal form and his transformation into a Chaos Spawn was complete. Khorne did not abandon Scylla, for the mortal had pleased the Blood God greatly, and so Scylla's mind was not entirely destroyed by the transformation and he was given a new, stable form of great physical might. Scylla became a giant, raging weapon of Khorne's will with strength and size beyond that of even the Daemon Princes. The Bloodbeast is so clearly blessed by Khorne that he spreads the dominion of his God as he rampages across the mortal realms."

#name "Salamander"
#descr "Salamanders are giant predatory amphibians that inhabit the swamplands and estuaries of the jungles. They are swift-moving creatures on both land and water, and are voracious hunters. On land they are capable of launching deadly accurate burst of flaming liquid from their gullet before charging forward to devour their prey with their powerful jaws. Underwater they are strong and agile swimmers, though they are unable to effectively use fire attacks against their foes. Properly trained by skilled Skink handlers, Salamanders may be turned loose in battle to wreak havoc amongst intruders to Lizardman territory."

#name "Razordon"
#descr "Like Salamanders, Razordons are deadly predators that inhabit the swamplands of the jungles. They prey on the various giant insects which swarm across their territory, particularly relishing the taste of the horse-sized Bale Wasp. The Razordon's favoured method of hunting is to wait in the mire with only its nostrils poking out then ambush its prey by suddenly convulsing, lashing its tail forward and launching a deadly volley of barbed spines. The Razordon then springs forth to crush its prey in its powerful jaws and swallow great hunks of it down whole. Skink handlers have learned to harness these aggressive but stealthy creatures in war, where their barbs are as deadly as crossbow bolts and their thick spined hide as tough as armour. Unlike their fire breathing cousins Razordons are not truly amphibious but are still strong swimmers and can cross rivers with relative ease."

The Temple Guard are a variant spawning of Saurus created to protect the Slann at all costs. They have more heavily armoured scales than other Saurus and instinctually possess an unshakeable resolve to guard their masters. Temple Guard are rarely spawned in these troubled times and most of their number are the veterans of countless battles, grown stronger and more savage with age. The Temple Guard will remain dormant and may not be recruited absent the presence of an awakened Slann. It would take an incredible feat to cause the Temple Guard to break from battle.

#descr "The Lizardmen forces of the Southlands make far greater use of Skink fighters, as Saurus are infrequently spawned and the last of the feared Oldblood generals died off long ago. Furthermore, the native creatures of the Southlands differ greatly from those of Lustria. The larger and stronger Cold Ones are replaced by quicker, smaller Horned Ones. Unable to bear the weight of a Saurus warrior, Horned Ones nontheless make excellent mounts for the more warlike Skinks of the Southlands and are often used in stealthy raids. Packs of these lightning fast cavalry flank enemy infantry and can take out unprotected missile troops with relative ease. Horned Ones, like horses, will not fight on after their rider is slain."

Due to their chameleonic skin which shifts to match their surroundings, they are capable of stalking their prey through any terrain, their protruding eyes scanning independently for threats while they stay absolutely motionless. Chameleon Skinks are known to have remained in place for hours on end awaiting the perfect ambush and even in open ground they are virtually impossible to see clearly. It had been so long since the last spawning of these Skinks that they were thought to be lost forever, but in these recent years of war, they have begun to spontaneously spawn across Lizardman territory, a sign from the Old Ones that the Slann have yet to decipher. They are armed with powerful poisoned blowpipes."

#descr "A number of Saurus warriors are born with a natural affinity for the volatile Cold Ones, large predatory reptiles which some refer to as the sharks of the land, so single minded and voracious are they. The Cold Ones are not near so fleet as a horse, but are powerful and dangerous creatures in their own right; Saurus cavalry are thus some of most powerful troops known. Formations of these cavalry are used to smash enemy elites, tear down great beasts or powerful warriors and generally cause a great deal of carnage in a very short time. The Cold Ones themselves are extremely thick skinned and resilient and the slime exuded from their scaly hide is capable of healing even grievous wounds inflicted on both beast and rider. Should the rider be slain his mount will fight on until the end of the battle before returning to the wilds."

Skinks have mastered the art of riding Terradons, guiding them to strike vulnerable foes with their vicious talons and beak while the Skink hurls down javelins with considerable force. While they are capable of quickly dealing a great deal of damage, neither Terradon nor Skink is built for pitched melee and they are quick to depart if faced with unfavourable odds. Terradons are silent killers capable of flying extremely close to the ground and often accompany Skink raiding parties.

While Terradons are quite readily trained as mounts Ripperdactyls see Skinks as nothing more than a snack and even those hand-raised from hatchlings often kill their masters. For this reason those Skinks who do succeed in controlling their mount tend to be a hardier more aggressive breed. Ripperdactyl Riders are armed and armoured for prolonged close combat unlike their skirmishing counterparts, but in truth it is the Ripperdactyl with its crushing jaws and decapitating talons that is the true weapon in the pairing. Should the rider be slain the Ripperdactyl will fight on before returning to its home in the cliffs."

Their strength is legendary, enough to uproot trees and, properly directed, help erect the great stone momuments of the Lizardmen. With sharp horns, ridges of spikes and a spined tail capable of cracking rocks, Stegadons are virtually unstoppable in battle by conventional means. Skink warchiefs have large howdahs strapped to these beasts and a crew of hunters fire upon the enemy with bows and javelins as the Stegadon charges forward.

Within days of first tasting the blood of Sotek's foes, they grow larger and stronger than their brethren and begin to goad them into even greater states of frenzy, leading constant raids and assaults. Other Saurus of Sotek bear bloodstain like markings on their back and crest, but the Bloodscales are almost entirely the colour of gore. In battle they unleash a terrible scream like the hissing of a thousand angry serpents and their mere presence can cause widespread panic. Bloodscales are avatars of Sotek's wrath whose axes are terrifyingly effective against the chosen of false gods. Legend has it that to even try to harm a Bloodscale might bring the vengeful attention of the serpent god. All of Sotek's chosen are immune to poison."

They harbour a particular hatred for Dark Elves, who are notorious for their plundering of artifacts left in the care of the Slann by the Old Ones themselves. All Saurus of Huanchi can deliver a poisonous bite, allowing for hit and run tactics against stronger enemies."

#descr "Those Saurus spawned under the influence of the predator god Huanchi are able to stalk their foes with effortless stealth, track them for great distances across almost any terrain and launch precise and lethal ambushes. The Nightscales are peerless trackers who will go to any lengths to hunt down and destroy those who oppose the will of the Old Ones. Larger and stronger than the Saurus of Huanchi under their command, they are no less cunning or patient and are notorious for cutting down the champions and mages of their foes before the Saurus close in to finish the enemy troops. Born to do battle with the most skilled and dangerous of Dark Elf leaders, they have developed both immunity to poison and a potent venemous bite of their own, as well as reflexes and agility almost a match for those of their hated enemies. As leaders of their sacred spawnings, they act as direct conduits of the Old One's will in much the same way as the Slann or Skink Priests."

As such they are virtually impossible to break in combat, only retreating when ordered and in perfect order. Their lack of response to any stimuli, including pain, means the Saurus of Tlazcotl are also rather difficult to dispatch in combat and furthermore, seem to have improved resistance to magic and fire. In the Great War against Chaos, the Saurus of Tlazcotl were famed for their impassive defence of the temple cities and they are still armed with the ancient daemon rending halberds of that time."

The Slann believe they have transcended their physical forms to join with the ineffable stillness of Tlazcotl and treat them with the highest respect. In addition to their incredible resilience, Nullscales never seem to tire and are as such utterly implacable foes. In the Great War against Chaos, the Saurus of Tlazcotl were famed for their impassive defence of the temple cities and they are still armed with the ancient daemon rending halberds of that time."

The obsinite weapons they wield may seem crude, but they are as deadly as any forged of steel. Saurus get tougher and more ferocious as they age and by the time they gain the title Scar Veteran they have undoubtedly seen hundreds of battles. Scar Veterans are trusted to lead small forces of troops and are formidable fighters, certainly more than a match for the champions of younger races."

Highly organised and social, Skinks work instinctively well in large groups and through their complex language of vocal calls and crest patterns, can accomplish tasks with quick efficiency. One in every few hundred Skinks, still a huge number in all, is spawned to serve the Slann in a more direct capacity, as a Priest. These Skinks are larger and bolder than their fellows and command a degree of respect even amongst the Saurus and Kroxigor, for they are the eyes of the Slann. Skink Priests generally attend to minor rituals and observances, though with fewer and fewer active Slann, their role in the plan of the Old Ones is increasing. Every Priest is attuned to the magical presence of the Slann and lends his power in battle through a constant communion."

Whether the Slann will ever take action against the followers of Sotek is unclear, but in the mean time their power grows. More and more spawnings show Sotek's influence and Skink Priests of Sotek are now a common sight, preaching a coming time of vengeance and making sacrifices to sate the thirst of the serpent God. Priests of Sotek are immune to poison and have dominion over snakes, indeed they have taken to using deadly poisonous jungle vipers as a means of protection. They have some skill in blood magic in addition to their native minor magic. Priests of Sotek are not naturally attuned to the communion of the Slann.

#descr "Saurus are ferocious warriors bred by the Old Ones specifically for war, with powerful jaws, slashing claws and spurs, tough scales and bony crests. Performing only the simplest tasks outside of warfare, Saurus may seem slow witted, but in battle the Skinks defer to their honed instincts and innate understanding of tactics. Saurus get tougher and more ferocious as they age and by far the oldest and thus most powerful amongst them are the Oldbloods. To have survived thousands of battles, perhaps even the Great War against Chaos, would be impossible for any ordinary Saurus. They ride to war on the back of a powerful Cold One bonded to them through the blessing of Itzl and as such the two fight as though they were a single being."

#descr "Chameleon Skinks are a subspecies of Skink that are distinguished from their fellows by their aggression, predatory instincts and sheer stealth. Due to their chameleonic skin which shifts to match their surroundings, they are capable of stalking their prey through any terrain, their protruding eyes scanning independently for threats while they stay absolutely motionless. Chameleon Skinks are known to have remained in place for hours on end awaiting the perfect ambush and even in open ground they are virtually impossible to see clearly. It had been so long since the last spawning of these Skinks that they were thought to be lost forever, but in these recent years of war, they have begun to spontaneously spawn across Lizardman territory, a sign from the Old Ones that the Slann have yet to decipher. They are armed with powerful poisoned blowpipes."

#descr "Where the Saurus were bred for war, the smaller and more dextrous Skinks were created by the Old Ones to see to the day to day running of the temple-cities. Highly organised and social, Skinks work instinctively well in large groups and through their complex language of vocal calls and crest patterns, can accomplish tasks with quick efficiency. However while it is generally true that the Skinks are not well suited to war, the will of the Old Ones is mysterious and some Skink are spawned with war in their blood. These larger, stronger, more aggressive Skink quickly take charge of their fellows and organise them to support the Saurus, displaying the same sort of instinctual grasp of tactics as their larger cousins. Warchiefs are proud of their status and mark themselves out with golden masks and obsinite weapons like those of the Saurus.

All Slann are linked in mind and their Priests are bound to this network, acting as conduits for their power.

Highly organised and social, Skinks work instinctively well in large groups and through their complex language of vocal calls and crest patterns, can accomplish tasks with quick efficiency. In the Southlands there are very few Slann remaining and spawning of Saurus are few and far between, leading to the Skinks taking on more active and warlike roles. The Skink population has exploded, with feral spawnings in the wild becoming more and more frequent. When a Skink marked out as a Priest is spawned in this manner they retain their magical aptitude, but are not connected in constant communion with the Slann. These rogue Shamans serve their race, but unlike their civilised cousins, they are not direct instruments of the Old Ones.

The Second Generation helped the Old Ones shape the world itself and they are truly godlike in their magical power. Yucatetl is truly blessed, for he alone of his generation was permitted audience with the Old Ones, though the experience blinded him to the material world. Yucatetl helped the First Generation guide the world through the heavens and set the four winds in motion. Even before the coming of Chaos Yucatetl sat motionless, staring into the void with blind unblinking eyes, but now he is awakened and narrowing his eyes to a pinprick of light, sees all that must be done. Yucatetl can cast rituals into even the most distant lands.

Nakai bears the marking of the Old Ones and albino colouration. His gnarled scales and spined ridges are crisscrossed with the scars of a thousand battles and his demise has been reported numerous times, but the Old Ones have a special plan for Nakai and he always returns to aid his people. It is believed Nakai was one of the first Kroxigor to spawn in Itza; he fought in numerous battles in the Great War against Chaos, reputedly slaying a Greater Daemon in single combat. Nakai's appearance at a temple city often precedes an invasion, but no city has fallen under his watch and he is considered one of the clearest signs that the Old Ones still favour their children. Nakai carries a great Daemon slaying obsinite club of incredible power and wears a pair of twinned bracers which grant him immunity to fire and cold."

The Master of Skies is granted two powerful artifacts by the Mage Priests; the Mask of Heavens and the Blade of Ancient Skies. The Mask grants Tiktaqto power over the air itself and provides protection against both enemy missiles and hostile magic.

His skills are commensurate with his age and he has destroyed both lone assassins and entire regiments in his countless years of vigil, not once losing a Slann under his protection.

As befits a sacred champion Gor Rok is equipped with the finest artefacts available, smiting his foes with the unerring Mace of Ulumak and halting even charging daemons with the Shield of Aeons.

The vile ratmen somehow overcame the disease, flora and fauna of Lustria and became agents of corruption, releasing plagues which devastated the Lizardman population. Cahqua and her resident Slann were ravaged by pestilence and Tehenhauin, sensing the city was doomed, gathered the sacred golden plaques and led the survivors into the jungle. These plaques spoke of the arrival of vengeful Sotek and Tehenhauin, sacrificing thousands of captured ratmen with his serpent blade, acted as his herald. As Prophet of Sotek Tehenhauin is able to unleash wave after wave of poisonous blood red snakes in battle."

As the great temple city of Pahuax fell, Oxyotl fought bravely to defend his Lord the Slann Mage-Priest Pocaxalan who unleashed an incantation supposed to blast the daemons back to their realm. Unfortunately even the great Slann could not control such magical power and the centre of the city vanished in a blinding flash of light. Oxyotl awoke to find himself in the nightmarish Realm of Chaos, scant paces away from daemons feasting on the remains of his Lord. None know how Oxyotl survived his daemonic pursuers, but he found his way back to Lustria only to realise over seven thousand years had passed. His return coincided with the first spawning of Chameleon Skins in memory and with his golden blowpipe he once again began to hunt those who would disrupt the Great Plan."

While the Warriors of Slaanesh are grimly focused on the task of butchery and pain, the Chosen are gifted heightened senses and a true passion for excess. They are known for to dance, sing, weep, laugh, cavort, even recite poetry or create art; indeed they will sometimes do all of these in the midst of a pitched battle. The Chosen have reached the end of their path, never destined to rise toward the ultimate goal of Daemonhood, but their souls will surely receive lavish attention from Slaanesh in death just as they have in life. The Chosen are sacred to the followers of the Dark Prince.

Even fairly small Marauder forces can occasionally find themselves benefitting from the presence of a handful of Ogres because these creatures are natural opportunists and recognise that in a smaller force they can bully their way to getting a larger share of the loot. Chaos Ogres have, despite their natural resistances, been changed by their exposure to Chaos and the attentions of the Ruinous Powers and are even stronger and more ferocious fighters than their former fellows in the Ogre Kingdoms.

#name "Chaos Troll"
#descr "Trollflesh is somewhat succeptible to the warping influence of Chaos but their natural ability to regenerate wages a constant battle with any mutation leading to the appearance of Chaos Trolls varying wildly and changing near constantly. Chaos Trolls are typically smarter, more aggressive, and more coordinated than the Trolls that find themselves goaded into battle by Greenskins but are still fundamentally brutish and prone to do whatever they please in a given moment; nonetheless Chaos warbands will entice them with a share of the loot and use them in battle. They are immensely strong and tough creatures famed for their regenerative prowess and are capable of vomiting a torrent of acidic bile on their opponents.

#name "Marauder Hellstrider"
#descr "Hellstriders are devotees of torment, Marauders who hunt from the back of impossibly swift Daemonic Steeds of Slaanesh. These gifts from the Dark Prince come at a great price, for the Hellstrider is curse, or perhaps blessed, to feel the pain of every victim of his hunts and expected to revel in the sensations. The Steeds are said to be made from the guilty desires of living creatures and as such can never be outrun, for no being could possibly escape its own darkest yearnings; what is certainly true is that their agility and speed is far beyond that of a horse. Steeds constantly taste the air with their long, whiplike tongues, sampling the scents and flavours of souls carried by the ever present the Winds of Magic and they are capable of hunting down almost any quarry. In battle the Marauder lashes his foes with a life draining Hellscourge whip while the Steed's tongue whips out at lightning speed, delivering poisons both deadly and psychoactive. Should the Marauder be struck from his Steed the beast will fight on for the rest of the battle before returning to the Realm of Chaos.

#name "Exalted Hero"
#descr "Exalted Heroes stand as paragons on the Path of the Warrior and the Champion, for they are everything that every Chaos Warrior and Aspiring Champion strives to be. The Exalted are monstrously powerful combatants capable of commanding forces of the mightiest warriors in the world, blessed many times over by their patron God and with an iron will to pursue their ambitions and become immortal. They are to the Aspiring Champions as the Chosen are to the Warriors, but unlike the Chosen they do not accept they have reached the zenith of their journey, for the prize of becoming a Chaos Lord and eventually a Daemon Prince still lies ahead of them and the risk of being reduced to a gibbering Chaos Spawn is one they gladly accept. Exalted Heroes of Slaanesh are incredibly talented artists of sensation and passion both on and off the battlefield, as capable of bringing men to tears with their singing, poetry, and dance as they are tearing through a formation of soldiers as a bloody whirlwhind of steel. They are also supremely arrogant to the point that they will actively force their troops to make space for them to enact a fittingly beautiful performance in battle.
[Requires friendly Dominion strength of 7 in the province to recruit]
[When this Exalted Hero is promoted it will transform to a form which will then be further transformed by an event, either becoming a Chaos Lord (and losing all its XP) or being turned into a mindless Chaos Spawn]

#descr "Most Marauder tribes will have one or two Shamans whose duty is to offer counsel to the Chieftain, interpret auguries to ensure successful raids, and lead the tribe in offering the proper observances to their patron God. Shamans tend to have only a little magical talent and rather than harnessing energy provided by the Ruinous Powers, they tap into the magic of their surroundings in the manner of hedge mages, witches, and other lesser mages. Shamans thus practice a different branch of magic from Sorcerers focused on veneration of the dead, the wilds, and the bitter cold of the polar lands. Shamans of Marauder tribes dedicated to Slaanesh in the guise of the Serpent carry staffs topped with snake skeletons and have some talent in the magic of the spheres and the minds of mortals.

Rather Marauder Chieftains are picked out by their Shamans and by former Chiefs to take the position, selected on the basis that they clearly have some favour from the Ruinous Powers, but have not attracted the potentially lethal full attention of their Patron God. The Marauder tribes are well known for their raids by sea and Marauder Chieftains can command fleets of cramped but efficient longboats to bear Marauders and Warriors to battle, though they aren't nearly large enough to transport cavalry.

All Sorcerers bear the clear favour of their patron God and are thus sacred to their warhosts, but Slaaneshi Sorcerers in particular are known to act as evangelical orators able to move the hearts and minds of mortal men in writhing exultation of the Prince of Pleasure.

Following the whisperings of the Daemon the young boy became a charming and successful princeling and led many successful raids on the coasts of the Old World. His father was eaten away by jealousy and insulted his son, who murdered him the midst of a great revelry in Styrkaar's honour. As he grew in status and embarked on the Path of the Champion Styrkaar's mind merged with that of the Daemon and he became truly favoured by Slaanesh, granted pale daemonic flesh, fine black armour, and his own Daemonic Mount. Styrkaar was one of the four Chaos Lords chosen by Archaon the Everchosen to head armies in support of his invasion of the Old World and it is clear that he is still destined for greater things."

#name "Prince of Damnation"
#descr "Azazel is one of the foremost of Slaanesh's Daemon Princes and holds the official title of Prince of Damnation, his purview being souls who have damned themselves through acts of great betrayal of their rulers or loved ones. In his former mortal life Azazel was a warrior of the Unberogen tribe named Gerreon who swore vengeance against Sigmar Heldenhammer for the death of his brother under Sigmar's command. Gerreon infiltrated Sigmar's honour guard and became a trusted friend to the heroic ruler, in time finding his ruse of loyalty had become truth rather than fiction. Though Gerreon had come to love Sigmar he still chose to betray him, badly wounding him and murdering his betrothed, Gerreon's own sister. Following this great betrayal Gerreon fled to the Chaos Wastes and became a Chaos Lord greatly favoured by the young Chaos God Slaanesh, eventually rising to Daemon Princehood. As a Daemon Prince Azazel wields incredible physical and magical might but his greatest power is his ability to corrupt and dominate the minds of mortals, for the Prince of Damnation appears to his foes as stunningly beautiful and impossible eloquent, just, and convincing. In battle Azazel descends silently on his enemies on graceful white wings and serenely butchers them with his scything claw or unholy sword. While they are Daemons in form their past in the mortal world grants Daemon Princes the benefit of not becoming weaker outside the Dominion of their God, though like Greater Daemons they can still only reform their bodies if slain in this Dominion.
[Azazel is primarily concerned with the corruption and damnation of men and as such is considered female for the purposes of the Seduction command]"

N'Kari is remarkable amongst Daemons for their singular focus; the sadistic Keeper of Secrets seems to be almost entirely dedicated to the corruption and ruination of the land of Ulthuan, specifically any who carry the bloodline of the great elven hero Aenarion. During Ulthuan's darkest hour with the fate of the mortal world hanging in the balance Aenarion was beset by four Greater Daemons sent by the Ruinous Powers it was N'Kari that came closest to felling the elf, but ultimately was destroyed and banished back to the Realm of Slaanesh, promising vengeance on his people. N'Kari is as patient, intelligent, and skilled in subterfuge as any Keeper of Secrets but eschews the art of corruption in favour of slaughter, assassination, and pain. As with all Daemons N'Kari is more powerful within the Dominion of Slaanesh and, as a Greater Daemon, they are capable of reforming their body should they be slain in this Dominion."

Tower Nobles are always accompanied by a sizeable retinue. They can organize defenses and are capable generals, provided they are willing support the ongoing war. Tower nobles rarely travel on foot and instead are carried in enchanted palaquins which protect them from most missile fire and offer a little bit of protection in melee."

But as the prayers went unanswered and the old faith reemerged, they had to watch in horror as Celestial Degrees were openly flaunted and the Magi they no longer held any sway over contacted the beings that had been driven off. Nowadays they are little more than secretive and silent guardians of the city's grand necropolis. By pledging themselves to the awakening god, they hope to regain relevance and find new purpose.

#name "Faqir"
#descr "The Faqir is an ascetic who has given up his previous life to eke out an existence in the unforgiving desert of 'Ad. The prospect of a punishing march across great distances and the struggle for survival is almost as familiar to them as the passing of each day. Equipped with two scimitars they throw themselves into battle with such reckless abandon that many consider them possessed or mad. Death holds few fears for these men at this point, as life in the desert gives people a certain fatalism. Many of them gather at Ma'bed Al-Shams and Al-Qala'ah Al-Makhfiyya to serve the Jinnun and their human priests."

When the city was conquered, they were tasked with enforcing his decrees and they immediatly set to work on the arduous work of ridding Al-Maqbarah Al-Kubra, Al-Mada'in's necropolis, of Ghuls and other beings that no longer had a place in the world of man. But as the prayers went unanswered and the old faith reemerged, they had to watch in horror as Celestial Degrees were openly flaunted and the Magi they no longer held any sway over contacted the beings that had been driven off. Nowadays they are little more than secretive and silent guardians of the city's grand necropolis. By pledging themselves to the awakening god, they hope to regain relevance and find new purpose. The Wardens don heavy armor and shields of foreign design and their enchanted masks allow them to perceive the unseen."

Men who surrender or those who are grievously wounded are branded and sold on Al-Suq, the city's grand bazaar. Old untreated wounds, harsh manual labor, and scant rations have left them weak and broken. During truly desperate times, slaves are armed with spears but are not given armor. Untrained, underfed, and demoralised due to their destitute conditions, slaves are likely to break if they face any real opposition."

Cultists quickly lose their grasp on reality and are more than willing to follow demagogues who claim to be chosen by the tattered kings. The Aspirants are priests of Carcosa's dream cult. They lead congregations in search of the Light that leaks from a fiercer place or call out to the Key and the Gate to open rifts into the Void.

The Sun-in-Rags is occasionally sighted in vivid dreams of cultists, wearing a shattered crown and accompanied by a silent retinue. The Tattered Kings are Lesser Suns and bound by divine laws to stay on the ground while shackled to this world, a fact which they greatly resent."

Many of them have lived to see, or been outright involved in the death of the last of the Dai Oni. Ever since the that time they have served as close confidants and advisors of the Emperor. While practicing the magic of the Way has allowed them to almost master their mortality, they are not truly immortal and many of them slowly but surely feel the end of their lives approach. Due to this they have worked on weakening the barrier between the worlds for the selfish reason of attaining true immortality. While some believe what they are looking for is located in Ikai, the world of spirits, others find themselves drawn to yet again study the dark realm of Yomi, enticed by myths and legends from times before man had come to Heijou."

When they do appear, they resemble faint orbs of light in the distance; or occasionally a tiny, funny-shaped vaguely humanoid figure. A Kodama's life force is directly tied to the tree it inhabits; if either the tree or its Kodama die or are separated, the other cannot live."

Cutting down such an ancient tree is a grave sin, and can bring down a powerful curse. Spirit trees are tended to by Kodama, small sprites connected to the tree's life force.

From afar, Jubokko appear to be ordinary trees, indistinguishable from the various species that dot the landscape. It takes an observant eye to notice the slightly more fearsome features of its branches or the piles of human bones buried in the undergrowth beneath the tree. Jubokko wait for unsuspecting prey to pass underneath their branches. When somebody gets close enough, they attack, snatching their prey with long, jagged, finger-like branches, and hoisting it into their boughs. These branches pierce the skin of their victims, sucking out all of the blood with tube-like twigs."

#descr "Nozuchi are powerful and ancient snake-like spirits of the fields, known for their bizarre shape and habits. Their bodies are covered in a very short bristly fur, much like a hairy caterpillar. Nozuchi have been known to attack humans who come near their homes. Their bites are dangerous and their touch results in terrible, mangled wounds which quickly lead to a high fever and death. They take the shape of a human priest, but with no eyes, nose, hair, or ears. The only feature on the head is a large, gaping mouth pointing upwards towards the sky. Wicked monks who are banished from their temples to live in the wilds sometimes gradually turn into nozuchi. Nozuchi are attuned to magic and their powers are greater in lands of magic."

Will he lose his reason, reduced to a cackling madman who can do naught but praise the beings who robbed him of his sanity? Perhaps he will lose his humanity, his mind elevated to the ranks of Carcosa's nobility to wander it's halls forever while dreaming. Many lose their self-control, becoming little more than mad slaughterers that kill and kill until they themselves lie dead in the dirt. But even then there are worse fates than insanity and death. There are those who fall even further from grace, who lose everything and become gibbering mounds of mutated flesh. Although physically powerful and extremely resilient, Void Spawn are often insane, mewling creatures with no mental powers or self-awareness. Their former intelligence has been sacrificed to their failed ambition. Many a cultist of great promise has ended up as a seething mound of bone and blubber, monstrous and screaming with lunatic rage. Some however survive the transformation with their minds intact, gaining much outworldly knowledge in the process of the transformation."

#descr "The Nether Realm is the realm of Frost and Death, of Decay and everlasting Perdition. It is the land of the dead where the souls of the wicked live out a miserable and tormented existence. Now, the veil separating the Nether Realm from the mortal, has weakened. Jealous of the living, the tormented souls of the Nether Realm have started seeping through the breach into Eljudnir, the first land of many to fall. The hollow existence of the undead has been given purpose, to purge the world of living and bring about eternal woe. Deathly, cold winds invigorate and surround these beings in an embrace of everlasting frost, tempering their bodies. They are vessels of Winter and Death, and their powers are greatest where it is coldest. The undead of the Nether Realm carry specially-crafted weapons, imbued with dark powers and corruption, that sap the very souls of the living. All those slaughtered by such weapons will arise to serve their slayers and bolster the ever-growing undead ranks."

Military: Powerful but extremely Cold-dependant and Fire-susceptible troops. Weapons can reanimate those killed in battle at times.

Dominion: Spreads Cold and Death (max 3)"

#name "Elphame"
#epithet "The Faery Courts"
#era 2
#descr "The Fay are magical beings of great powers, but also ones fundamentally and rigidly bound to their peculiar nature, lacking the free will to act against it. Most faries are often quite insane too, though their particular brand of insanity is perhaps of a different color to that of mortals, and is perceived through their capriciousness, whimsy, and inability to act reasonably. One of the better known yet misunderstood shackles of the Fay is their inability to outright lie. However, being exceptionally deceptive, the Fay are very adept at word-play and twisting their meaning and walking the thin border of falsehoods and implied truths. Built into the Fay is also a great urge to entrap mortals and seek to make bargains, or enlist oaths and promises from them, which, when spoken to the Fay, carry with them great power and turn true and unbreakable. Lastly, all Fay are ultimately shackled by the concept of balance, of give and take. Apart from being bound to only speak the truth, the Fay are also quite unable to offer up anything - no matter how trivial - without receiving something of equal worth in return. As such, a deal struck that is anything but an equal exchange will be deemed either enticing or an insult, and therefor one would be wise to never accept nor offer anything to the Fay of their own volition, for all of reality might depend on it.
Elphame is divided into four seasonal courts ruled by corresponding Queens of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. As seasons change in Elphame, so shifts the influence and power of the Queens, ever expanding and dwindling, in an endless, repetitive cycle. Conflict is a constant between the Courts of Faery, as it is in their nature, yet the balance of power can never be broken. Though there are four royal courts of Elphame, one for each respective season, most of the Fay belong to one of two main groups, the Seelie Fay - those of the Spring and Summer Court - and the Unseelie Fay - those of Autumn and Winter."
#summary "Race: Faeries. Unwilling to pass rivers as running water washes away their powers.
Military: Low morale across the board. Sacreds and Faery Queen recruitables change from season to season. All national units have a +6 mapmove bonus in friendly dominion.
Magic: Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Nature, Death.
Priests: Powerful.
Dominion: Spreads Luck and Turmoil. 5% per dominion point chance to increase by +1."

#descr "Khora is a formless interval. It is an otherworldly place that exists outside of the physical universe, and none of the beings inhabiting it have either shape nor location, much like the realm itself. Khora is sometimes also referred to as the non-realm of creation. It represents the unintelligible substratum of the material universe and it is the realm from which all other realms were given shape, or rather sung into being by the Demiurges, the primordial gods of this realm, and the shapers of the material universe. In the formless realm the Demiurges can turn amorphous, into voices, or ideas, though what they are is the song that echoes across the universe. Their song brings with it creation, and it is said that when their grand symphony is finally played out across the spheres, the universe will come to an end.
Though Khora is a formless plane without a location, it is connected to the material universe at certain junctions. One such junction, whether by design or happenstance, is in the land of the Daemons, savage and irrational beings of great brutality - but also vast potential - to whom the Demiurges have gradually started revealing the secrets of the cosmos and teaching them the music of the spheres."
#summary "Race: Demiurges and Daemons. Cannot construct national forts, can only create them through rituals.

#name "Musafir"
#epithet "The Wandering Tribes"
#era 2
#descr "Musafir is a vast desert plain where numerous, small and spread-out nomadic tribes dwell, continuously migrating from oasis to oasis and vying for control with other tribes over the few precious resources the desert has to offer. A recent shift in politics, brought on by numerous prophetic visions from Soothsayers and now returning Farseers alike, has ended the tribal conflicts and given rise to the uniting of the desert tribes under the leadership of the new god of the Harsh Sands. Musafir now stands as a nation of loosely-tied tribes. The centuries-long practice of enslaving other tribes has mostly ended but slavery still exists, possibly stronger than ever. The enslavement of the traveler tribes has been substituted for the mass enslavement of the newly-discovered Tigrans, a race of ferocious but primitive intelligent tigers, and other nations.
The tribes of Musafir have long since accustomed themselves to a life of a traveler. Indeed their very name, Musafir, means one that travels. They are used to never settling for long in one place and have even developed ways of migrating entire settlements. Though the forts they build are often small and primitive - a reality of the harsh life in the desert, their simplicity makes it possible for them to carry the building blocks using numerous beasts of burden and setting them up elsewhere. The nomadic nature of the Musafir tribes and their distant travels have also given rise to a unique new opportunity, a rich new market of spice trading. Merchants laden with spices travel from one land to another, selling exotic spices for a hefty profit.
Over their long years and numerous leagues the people of Musafir have become master traders and skilled diplomats. As such it is little wonder that they are able to negotiate extremely favorable deals and contract mercenary companies cheaper than usual."
#summary "Race: Humans. Prefer Heat scale +1.  Can migrate entire settlements with all accompanying buildings, including forts, to other land. Can send trade caravans to friendly cities and even other nations for profit. Mercenaries cost 10 percent less. Nation starts with an extra 100 gold.
Military: Light infantry, light cavalry, archers. Sacred Guardians of the Oasis. Various types of caravans.
Magic: Fire, Air, Astral, some Death.
Priests: Moderate."

#era 2
#descr "With Ermor's swift rise to power and prominence came the persecution of the numerous, scattered druidic circles. In the ensuing years of Ermor's aggressive military campaigns many druids died, but many also fled far and wide, until they discovered an ancient and hidden grove unlike any they had ever seen. There, the exiled druids were given shelter and protection by the primordial spirits of the forest, called the Sylvans. Now, the druids of Nemeton and the Sylvans live in communion and safeguard each other against would-be intruders.
The druids of Nemeton live in small communities centered around sacred Sylvan groves. They rarely build permanent settlements or fortifications as they have little use for them. Instead, they rely on powerful Sylvan enchantments to shelter them from prying eyes. The people of Nemeton are capable of moving unseen through forests, as the very forests guide and reinvigorate their every step. Even the weapons they carry strike with the power of the forest and entangle those struck by them."
#summary "Race: Human. Have no use of forts. Can only place additional settlements in forests, by moving Sylvans and creating new groves.
Military: Light and medium infantry, light boar cavalry, archers. Troops become stealthy while in forest, and receive weapons that can entangle.
Magic: Nature, Earth, Water, some Air. Mages gain +1 Nature magic while in forest.
Priests: Average."
#brief "Nemeton is a sanctuary to numerous druids, exiled and hunted down by Ermor. It is also the home of the Sylvans, ancient and powerful spirits of the forest."

#descr "Khorne is one of the four Ruinous Powers, the Gods of Chaos that draw strength from the darkest mortal emotions and drives. Khorne is known as the Blood God and Lord of Skulls, for their domain is violence, battle, rage, glory, and murder. Each of the Ruinous Powers seeks dominion over the realms of mortals and advantage over their siblings, for to them all life is but a game. Greatest in number of the followers of Slaanesh are the Marauders, hardened human warriors from the tribes that surround the Chaos Wastes and are sometimes joined by Ogres or Trolls drawn by the prospect of great reward. Above the Marauders in status are the Chaos Warriors, elite fighters blessed with martial prowess and physical strength, and the Chosen Warriors who show Khorne's direct favour. Commanding the followers of Khorne are Champions, Exalted Heroes, and Chaos Lords, each of which seeks to some day ascend to immortality in the form of a Daemon Prince, though most on this path will die in battle or fail to meet Khorne's standards and be twisted into a mindless Chaos Spawn. Finally the Daemons of Khorne are the most direct and horrifying servants of the Blood God, for they are the essence of Khorne given form and unleashed upon the world."

#brief "The Lizardmen were created by the Old Ones, divine interstellar beings of unimaginable power. For thousands of years they have tended to the will of these beings and protected the world from Chaos."
#descr "The Lizardmen are a race of reptillian servants created by the Old Ones thousands of years ago. A servant race, they exist only to enact the Great Plan of the Old Ones. The Old Ones brought with them the First Generation of Slann and spawned four more generations to rule over the warlike Saurus, nimble Skinks and mighty Kroxigor. However a Great Catastrophe struck the world and heralded the arrival of Chaos at the poles; since that time the Old Ones have been absent. In their stead, the Lizardmen stand as guardians against Chaos and shape the world according to the Great Plan. Largely isolated in Lustria, the Lizardmen have watched and waited for a time when Chaos might be defeated and the world restored for the glorious return of their masters. Countless years of divination and consultation with the stars has revealed that time to be now and with the Awakening God the lizardmen shall set the world right once again."
#summary "Race: Cold blooded lizard people ruled by ancient Slann. Prefer heat scale +2.
Military: Skink skirmishers, savage Saurus warriors, and large jungle creatures. Sacred Temple Guard only recruitable in the presence of a Slann.
Magic: Extremely powerful Astral, Nature and Elemental magic with a separate path into Blood.

#brief "Slaanesh is one of the four Ruinous Powers, the Gods of Chaos that draw strength from the darkest mortal emotions and drives.

#descr "Slaanesh is one of the four Ruinous Powers, the Gods of Chaos that draw strength from the darkest mortal emotions and drives. Slaanesh is known as the Prince of Pleasure, for their domain is extreme sensation, fear, and lust. Each of the Ruinous Powers seeks dominion over the realms of mortals and advantage over their siblings, for to them all life is but a game. Greatest in number of the followers of Slaanesh are the Marauders, hardened human warriors from the tribes that surround the Chaos Wastes and are sometimes joined by Ogres or Trolls drawn by the prospect of great reward. Above the Marauders in status are the Chaos Warriors, elite fighters blessed with martial prowess and physical strength, and the Chosen Warriors who show Slaanesh's direct favour. Commanding the followers of Slaanesh are Champions, Exalted Heroes, and Chaos Lords, each of which seeks to some day ascend to immortality in the form of a Daemon Prince, though most on this path will die in battle or displease Slaanesh and be twisted into a mindless Chaos Spawn. Finally the Daemons of Slaanesh are the most direct and horrifying servants of the Dark Prince, for they are the essence of Slaanesh given form and unleashed upon the world."

#era 2
#descr "The great city of Al-Mada'in lies on the ruins of Kardbandad, an ancient trading kingdom established by the Jinnun of Ubar. Old Kardbandad was abandoned when the Gates of Brass were sealed, leaving the human servants and oasis dwellers to fend for themselves. Over the countless centuries since the Ubar's chastisement, Al-Mada'in has been razed, resettled, and conquered countless times, always rising from ruin due to being situated on the only safe route through the desert of 'Ad. The enormous city is ruled by oligarchs who have made their homes in the spires of ancient Kardbandad from which they administer the city. Outside of the great walls, life has not changed much since the time of Ubar, and practitioners of Sahar, the ancient magic of the Jinnun, rule the tribes."
#summary "Race: Humans, prefers Heat scale +1
Military: Tribesmen and well trained household troops. Military orders in the capital.
Magic: weak Fire and Air outside of the capital, access to Fire, Air, Earth, Astral, Death and Blood in the capital provinces.
Priests: Mediocre, can enter communions
Capital province has 25% lower population and gem income but starts surrounded by forts with additional population and magic sites"
#brief "Al-Mada'in is a nation of humans centered around a great city. Military orders and old cults are slowly adopting the New Faith and trying to gain influence over the unruly population. Iram's armies are mostly made up of lightly armed tribesmen but the realm's nobles employ their own well trained retinues."

#descr "Once a prosperous metropolis, Carcosa is now a warped and broken reflection of its former self. When the Pantokrator disappeared, so did his seven seals that protected the world from the horrors of the void. One such entity was the Sun in Splendour, a being of great radiance that fell onto the world and shattered upon collision with the city of Carcosa. While its corpse has grown dimmer in the world of man, in the astral spheres its radiance has not diminished and some shards have regained conscience. Making use of the remaining light as a beacon, the Dreams of Carcosa and the Light from a fiercer place invade weak minds through the accursed Yellow Sign. Hordes of dreamers and madmen gather under the command of the Tattered Kings in their bid for Godhood and perhaps, a chance of reforming what has been lost."

Yet the land is far from peaceful as rival temple factions and noble houses compete for influence in the provinces and court sorcerers still meddle with forces from Ikai, the world of spirits, in search of immortality. The influences of their careless studies can already be felt as strange half-men lurk in desolate and forgotten places and spirits emerge from the mists during nighttime.

There are many strange abilities the Fay are rumored to possess, though perhaps chief among them is their seeming ability to bend time to their will. All know impossible tales of men and women who had accidentally or foolishly ventured into the lands of faery and returned to their homes days later, only to discover years, or even centuries had somehow gone by.
With this ancient bit of trickery a faery will create a powerful enchantment and blanket a small portion of the land with it. All those within this enchanted area will find themselves subject to the whims of the faery who will be able to, quite literally, turn back time and reset the day for all those within the enchanted area. Though the faery will retain her ability to turn back time and reset the day, doing so will not magically mend the wounds of those injured, nor bring those killed in the enchanted area back to life at the turn of the clock. The only thing that prevents a faery from eternally trapping others in such a maddening prison of time is the necessity of being present in the enchanted area for the enchantment to work, a fact that would eventually lead to the faery's discovery and demise."

When a Demiurge is slayed, it may take many years, or perhaps even centuries for their song to reach the material spheres again. Unlike the lesser Demiurges who may be freely ushered into the world with a potent enough spellsong, the songs of the Nine are too great to be carried by anyone other than themselves. Once their song has passed from the material realm, it cannot be freely summoned back by any means. However, when a Demiurge dies, their song, their essence, can be captured before it passes through the material realms by performing a Requiem. Such a complex act is not easily done, and holds a number of caveats which further complicate the matter. None but the Nine are powerful enough to perform such a spellsong, and there is but a brief window of opportunity to perform it before the song of the slayed Demiurge passes out of reach."
#details "When cast on the turn any of the nine Demiurges die, it will return the killed ones to the recruitment pool and enable them to be recruited once again. As Demiurges are unique commanders they will carry over any experience, empowerments, or other traits acquired.

All troops recruited under this enchantment will permanently retain weapons enchanted by the Sylvan, capable of entangling enemy troops on hit. Furthermore, the Sylvan Communion will make troop recruitment easier by reducing recruitment points of units. The spell lasts longer for every gem spent on the ritual. The enchantment will not dissipate if the province is lost, however a Sylvan is still needed to be present in order to gain benefits from it.  "

Even in the Realms of Chaos the Bloodthirsters are feared, for in direct combat they are more than capable of slaying the Greater Daemons of the other Ruinous Powers, in some cases destroying the forms of many of these mighty foes.

As the cultist recites the mantra, his flesh will begin to rip and tear, reshaping him into a new form, more suited to a permanent existence in the void. Many find the pain of the transformation unbearable, but the proper words must be spoken when the Change comes. Should the aspirant fail to complete the ritual, he will longer be able to dream but receive the blessing of a refined mind. Void spawns who suffer this fate intuitively know the will of the Void and act accordingly. In other words, they don't act at all unless led by mages or other madmen.

However, wearing the ring is demanding and taxes the well-being of the wearer. The ring will make the bearer feeble, and will exhaust him with every step in combat. His dependence upon magical energies will weaken him further, instead of strengthen him, if they are low. It will vex him by taking away his power of speech. Finally, as a side effect of the strange magics of the ring, the owner will develop a taste for human flesh, and will soon find himself impelled to hunt local villagers to satisfy his ravenous cravings."

Each of your military leaders (Goblin Boss, Nightgoblin Boss, Orc Boss, Black Orc Big Boss) will be 'promoted' when they reach a certain amount of experience points. This will add the term 'Rising' to their name, e.g. 'Orc Boss Rising', but they will otherwise be unchanged. Any 'Rising' Boss, Big Boss, or Warboss has a chance each turn to trigger an event which will transform them to the next tier of military commander and grant them some free troops. This transformation will also remove most of their gained experience, allowing them to earn it and become 'Rising' once more. Only one of these promotion events can happen in each province in each turn.
The intention here is to encourage you to actively use your military commanders in combat and level them up, eventually reaching the hallowed status of Waaaghboss. So get stuck in!
For Black Crag the progressions are as follows:
Goblin Boss -> Goblin Big Boss -> Goblin Warboss -> Goblin Waaaghboss
Nightgoblin Boss -> Nightgoblin Big Boss -> Nightgoblin Warboss -> Nightgoblin Waaaghboss

#msg "Welcome! Khorne has some special mechanics which make them a little different from other nations:
Path of the Warrior. Your Chaos Warriors and Knights can, through XP, earn the chance to be promoted to a Chosen. This won't trigger until the turn after the game announces their promotion and will only happen when they are outside of their home province (for technical reasons). They will then face the judgement of Khorne and may be either Chosen, Forsaken, or twisted into a mindless Chaos Spawn.
Path of the Champion. Your military commanders can also earn promotion for a chance of a more powerful form, though unlike the troops it can trigger even in their home province. Aspiring Champions can become Exalted Heroes who can become Chaos Lords who can reach the final stage and become a Daemon Prince. At each stage of judgement they may fail Khorne and be turned into a mindless Chaos Spawn (killing them and giving you a Spawn as a troop), though the Spawn generated will tend to be more powerful than those you get from failed troop promotions. Additionally you may receive random rewards from Khorne, who is pleased by mortal ambition.
Red Harvest. Khorne rewards conquest with blood. Each province you control has a 10% chance multiplied by your candles present to grant 1d3 blood slaves. This chance is doubled if you have a temple in the province."

#msg "Welcome! Slaanesh has some special mechanics which make them a little different from other nations:
Path of the Warrior. Your Chaos Warriors and Knights can, through XP, earn the chance to be promoted to a Chosen. This won't trigger until the turn after the game announces their promotion and will only happen when they are outside of their home province (for technical reasons). They will then face the judgement of Slaanesh and may be either Chosen, Forsaken, or twisted into a mindless Chaos Spawn.
Path of the Champion. Your military commanders can also earn promotion for a chance of a more powerful form, though unlike the troops it can trigger even in their home province. Aspiring Champions can become Exalted Heroes who can become Chaos Lords who can reach the final stage and become a Daemon Prince. At each stage of judgement it may please Slaanesh to turn them into a mindless Chaos Spawn (killing them and giving you a Spawn as a troop), though the Spawn generated will tend to be more powerful than those you get from failed troop promotions.
Dominion of Sensation. Your dominion has increased importance because some recruitables are locked behind minimum levels, your Daemons are weaker outside your dominion, and your dominion decreases unrest for provinces you control and increases it if the enemy does, based on its strength."
