#descr "Even if he could spend ten lifetimes in Iridia, living right next door to the Mirror Tower, a simple commoner could never stop being amazing at the madness of it. Guarded by a host of giants donned in mesmerizing armor polished to a mirror shine, the tower is home to many a Illusionist constantly practicing the art. Under a regular barrage of deceptive magic, the tower changes its appearance daily, sometimes even hourly. In the morning it may appear engulfed in flames only to completely vanish at the strike of noon until somebody accidentally walks into it, bloody nose in hand. Living under the confusing glare of the Mirror Tower the people of Iridia have long since learnt to stop paying attention to strange occurrences, choosing to simply ignore them rather than live in a perpetual state of dismay. This has lead to no small amount of unfortunate events, such as fires being left to ravage the city unopposed, believed to be yet another in a long line of illusions to regularly disrupt the city.
The impossible tower of illusions at the very heart of Iridia is protected by the Mirror Guard, elite soldiers made to appear as giants through the art of Illusionism.

#descr "The Phantasmagorian is a shape-shifting being that takes on the form of its observers' worst nightmares. Due to their shape-shifting abilities, no one actually knows or can even speculate what a Phantasmagorian looks like. In fact, it likely doesn't even have a form but rather project an illusion of one directly into its observer's mind, given that several people can look at the Phantasmagorian and argue about the vastly differing appearance of the horrifying being they're staring at. Living between worlds the Phantasmagorians have an unsettling ability to capture unwarded teleporting travelers and even dreamers within the Void and feed on their fears and emotions. The ability of the Masters Macabre to conjure equally horrifying images and delight in the fear they cause in others makes them closely associated with this monster and may explain why they have succeeded in befriending the creature. Though the Phantasmagorian is also a master of the macabre it is itself a rather cowardly creature."

In order to create such eyes, a mixture of soap and mercury is heated in a rune-covered retort until they are both vaporized. The vapors are then carefully blown through a long silver straw until a bubble forms at the tip. It is then left to dry in the reflection of the sun in 13 small concave silver mirrors.

#descr "The biggest difference between a skilled Illusionist and a Master Illusionist is perhaps their state of mind. Living in a big web of illusions and deceptions tends to blur the borders of reality and fiction, at times prompting even the most skilled Illusionist to wonder whether his surroundings are real or imaginary, or part of somebody else's imagination. Such a precarious way of life tends to take a tall on the individual's mind which explains why few attain the title of a Master Illusionist and why even few even bother.
A Master Illusionist is not only able to hide himself from prying eyes, but can even create illusions that confound all senses and make him invisible to the naked eye, though a Master Macabre can boast of much the same with the addition of making anyone's deepest, darkest fear quite visible and driving them insane with fear."

Those with enough skill to survive the streets long enough to attract the interest of the masters are accepted into the Mirror Tower and are given proper training. Here, the apprentices spend several years perfecting the art of Illusionism, but also the art of making flawless mirrors, for the power of the Mirror Tower primarily lies within the mirrors, quite literally.

The Crystal Citadel at the heart of Iridia is a place where mirrored walls cast reflection upon reflection upon reflection in an infinite maze of illusions that leaves the unprepared visitor dazzled and disoriented. In the Illusionists' domain, the border between the real and the unreal is crossed as casually as a peasant crosses his field. One never knows whether the things he sees are real or simply figments of his own, or someone else's, imagination. The conjurations of an Illusionist are fragile, instantly dispelled when confronted with hard reality. Yet despite their ephemeral nature, they have a very real power to affect living things. That which is seen and believed will have a physical effect upon those who do not realize they are dealing with the unreal and illusionary blades will inflict real, bleeding wounds on their bodies.
Illusionists are considered the most untrustworthy of all the magicians. They are regarded as spinners of lies, charlatans, and confidence artists caught in their own web of lies. Most other mages discard their magic as petty tricks and deception. The best way to counter the Illusionists' magic is to simply ignore and disbelieve anything they say or do."

#descr "At the very top of the Mirror Tower there exists a hidden vault where the most precious mirrors patiently await, preserved under a thin veil of dust and cobwebs. Though these mirrors are few in number with some of them even many hundreds of years old, they represent the pinnacle of the art of Illusionism. Unlike Golden Mirrors which hold amateurish and blurry semblances of things, or Silver Mirrors which hold quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this great vault hold images that are nigh perfect in every regard. The images held are so impeccable they will even bleed when cut, and no amount of disbelieving their existence will work, begging the question at which point does a copy of something start being as real as the original. The only thing that seems to set the monsters captured in these mirrors apart from their real counterparts is a lack of free will, or perhaps a soul. As a Monstrous Mirror can hold trapped within it any number of images many Master Illusionists spend their entire lives slowly adding to their ever growing collection. A Master Illusionist's life work is typically finished once he fumbles a ritual and is killed by the monster whose image he is attempting to trap within the great mirror. Though Monstrous Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds or exotic monsters, only as many as an Illusionist dares control are released when the mirror is activated."

#descr "At the very top of the Mirror Tower there exists a hidden vault where the most precious mirrors patiently await, preserved under a thin veil of dust and cobwebs. Though these mirrors are few in number with some of them even many hundreds of years old, they represent the pinnacle of the art of Illusionism. Unlike Golden Mirrors which hold amateurish and blurry semblances of things, or Silver Mirrors which hold quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this great vault hold images that are nigh perfect in every regard. The images held are so impeccable they will even bleed when cut, and no amount of disbelieving their existence will work, begging the question at which point does a copy of something start being as real as the original. The only thing that seems to set the monsters captured in these mirrors apart from their real counterparts is a lack of free will, or perhaps a soul. As a Macabre Mirror can hold trapped within it any number of images many Master Illusionists spend their entire lives slowly adding to their ever growing collection. A Master Illusionist's life work is typically finished once he fumbles a ritual and is killed by the monster whose image he is attempting to trap within the great mirror. Though Macabre Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds of horrifying monsters, only as many as an Illusionist dares control are released when the mirror is activated."

#descr "At the very top of the Mirror Tower there exists a hidden vault where the most precious mirrors patiently await, preserved under a thin veil of dust and cobwebs. Though these mirrors are few in number with some of them even many hundreds of years old, they represent the pinnacle of the art of Illusionism. Unlike Golden Mirrors which hold amateurish and blurry semblances of things, or Silver Mirrors which hold quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this great vault hold images that are nigh perfect in every regard. The images held are so impeccable they will even bleed when cut, and no amount of disbelieving their existence will work, begging the question at which point does a copy of something start being as real as the original. The only thing that seems to set the monsters captured in these mirrors apart from their real counterparts is a lack of free will, or perhaps a soul. As a Macabre Mirror can hold trapped within it any number of images many Master Illusionists spend their entire lives slowly adding to their ever growing collection. A Master Illusionist's life work is typically finished once he fumbles a ritual and is killed by the monster whose image he is attempting to trap within the great mirror. Though Macabre Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds or exotic monsters, only as many as an Illusionist dares control are released when the mirror is activated."

The lesser races and their gods sealed the astral gates behind the Ether Warriors to ensure the safety of the world. Ether Warriors are powerful beings and can live for centuries unless slain in battle. All members of the race are ethereal and very difficult to harm with non-magical weapons.

Similarly, to hide something one must know how to distort light. In recent years the Mirror Tower has focused much of its attention towards the art that has come to been known as light-splitting.
A Mirror-Mage is a Master Illusionist who has successfully split light in front of the Prismatic Mirrors of the Mirror Tower, separating from his shadow and his very image, turning completely invisible in the process. One does not become a Mirror-Mage without some sacrifice however as splitting oneself inadvertently splits power as well, though many consider this a small price to pay for attaining god-like powers; turning invisible and existing in multiple forms at once."

#descr "Unlike a Mirror-Mage's phantasm, a Mirror-Mage's shadow appears to be neither soulless nor a lifeless construct. The shadows seem to inherit the darker parts of one's nature during the light splitting as any mystical or dark knowledge seem to be primarily inherited by the shadow. Perhaps most interestingly, shadows seem to be banishable by priests. Many have already called into question whether the prismatic mirrors split the Illusionist's image or rather his soul and power."

By performing an impossible feat of magic, through the use of the Mirror Tower's great prismatic mirrors, the Mirror Lord has managed to refract his being into three distinct parts; his living shadow, the uninhibited impulses and his darker nature, his manifest image, the mindless subconscious instincts of his being, and his 'self', the ego, the intangible intellect of the being that is the Mirror Lord. Now, donning a godly mantle, the Mirror Lord has taken the role of a Pretender God. He is a master of magic and can be adept in several of the magic paths.
The Mirror Lord Phantasm will gain the primary magic path, Air, in equal amount to the Mirror Lord, or up to a maximum of A4.
The Mirror Lord Shadow will gain the Mirror Lord's skill in Death magic up to a maximum of D4."

These great and mesmerizing mirrors are more than a curiosity to many an Illusionist. Despite the best efforts of some of the most notable Illusionists nothing can apparently be bound inside a Living Mirror, apart from the very Illusionists attempting to bind images within it. The Living Mirrors seem to posses a will of their own and have a penchant for devouring Illusionists that come too close. Much like how Illusionists collect many different monsters inside their enchanted mirrors, the Living Mirrors seem to collect various Illusionists.
When threatened the Living Mirror will release several random Illusionists for the duration of the battle."

#descr "The Mirror Tower holds many secrets and peculiar enchanted objects, perhaps none more intriguing than Living Mirrors, ancient mirrors carved out of strange gemstones and flowing colours. These great and mesmerizing mirrors are more than a curiosity to many an Illusionist. Despite the best efforts of some of the most notable Illusionists nothing can apparently be bound inside a Living Mirror, apart from the very Illusionists attempting to bind images within it. The Living Mirrors seem to posses a will of their own and have a penchant for devouring Illusionists that come too close. Much like how Illusionists collect many different monsters inside their enchanted mirrors, the Living Mirrors seem to collect various Illusionists.
When threatened the Living Mirror will release several random Illusionists for the duration of the battle."

#descr "To gather any larger group of Hoburghers can often prove to be an insurmountable feat, something that can be seen in the traditional Hoburg defense force, the militia. The militia consists of the free Hoburghers gathering every Sunday to parade with crude metal helmets and eat fruitcake. The militia is usually a sorry sight and does not provide much in terms of fighting power. Being badly armed and small in stature, they offer no real resistance. It is often assumed that the compact stature of the Hoburghers originates from their close affinity with the earth that they traditionally toil, as it tries to pull them back down. However, some documentation of their earlier history have revealed partial evidence that they originally lived in burrows, living off of worms and dead animals. It is possible that their great appetite stems from this earlier constant hunger."

The hammers were then called Louse Hammers. If one asks a Hammerer the answer would instead be that the hammers are the trademark of Luzern’s Fine Metal Wares which gives it its name, but as they are pretentious and snobby, it is obvious that the former origin of the name rings closer to the truth. The Hammerers are still required to carry a small hammer as it has also been noted in the fielded armies that a soulless that has lost a limb can be easily if somewhat temporarily fixed with a hammer and a nail.

#name "Ghoul Hog Hussar"
#descr "For the travelers who have had the opportunity to observe both Hoburg and Hobmark troops, the Markgraf’s units often appear as bleak copies of the Hoburg troops. However, there is a difference when it comes down to the Hoburg Hussars. The original Markgraf, being a pig farmer himself, went into painstaking efforts to set up his own elite of hog riders. The Hog Hussars are more lightly armored than the Hog Knights, sporting only a light cuirass and favoring a Hobmark saber, making them deadly as they circle the enemy foot soldiers."

However, some other source stipulate that undead are knighthood consequently the ponies because they have a preference for humanoid flesh rather than animal."

#descr "In the contract between the markgraf guardians and the Markgraf, a small clause can be read that they should serve the Graf beyond the point of death, both his or theirs, an eventuality not all that uncommon given the recent troubles. Though some of the guardians do follow their ward in to the everlasting embrace of unreadiness, most are not so willing to serve. Due to the clause, and the almost sacred nature of business-contacts between the Hoburgs, they are bound to follow them. The unwillingness to actually die turns them into more vicious and less aware creatures. As they almost act on instinct one has to beware of his bodyguards whenever one is in a meeting with the Ghoul Baron."

Though the Hoburghers generally lack an understanding and prowess in the arts of magic, some seem to still have an understanding for the art of Necromancy, perhaps due to their close association with the soil. A few years ago there was even a Hoburg Necromancer, Sigsimunda Strobel, at this very College, who was not without insight into the Dark Arts. Recently the Nekromants gained access to the Markgraf’s council, because they cooperated in finding a way to copy the Hoburg manufactures. Being well-versed in the art of preservation, one of the first manufactures to be populated sole by undead workers was the manufacture of ‘Hermann Flesher’s Fine Pickled Meats’. There were some complaints of fingers in the pickles, which pitched the Markgraf into a lengthy legal battle with the Fletcher family."

At times a revived corpse will only retain its memory but no willpower in which case it becomes a ghost, none of its previous hungers drives it on and it is just a lingering. In the opposite case it is just the hunger driving it. As easily understood it is difficult to revive a hoburg and have the resulting corpse not be overwhelmed by hunger. The easiest way to let the subject of the revivification retain some memories would be to start the reanimation process just a few minutes before the subject dies. As such it is not a popular procedure, but lured by the promise of eternal life and eternal dinners, some of the markgrafs let themselves be talked into this by the nekromants."

Being bested in an election to the title of Burmeister, the ancestor of the current Markgraf decided to withdraw himself from the Hoburg society altogether, setting up his domain as that of a Graf, modeled on the human Barons. For a few generations this remote area of the Hoburg society was more or less self-sufficient, if a bit leaner than their neighbors. The Markgraf managed to live well off his subjects and no dissenters to his rule survived to tell any tales. Many Hoburgers of ill repute have found a refuge in the towns of the Markgrafdom, which had already broken with the customs of the Hoburg society. As the Markgraf’s domains are more barren and worn down than the rest the Hoburg lands, the Markgrafs have tried every means available to improve the lot of their subjects and themselves."

Spending the money earned from manufactures and settled lawsuits on research in order to investigate an old rumor in the Markgraf annals, he hoped to gain power for himself. We at the College of Cerebra Magni were happy to be able to present the results of our studies, which indicated that the Nekromant could aid the Markgraf in achieving a status of powerful undeath. The disadvantage being that he requires the blood of living people on a constant basis, though not necessarily that of Hoburghers. There are some uncertainties as to how he received our results, because the envoys that were sent with the results seem to have disappeared during their travels. However, the Markgraf has since paid the monies due and even offered a stipend for young scholars to travel to the Markgrafdom to study."

#descr "Though the original vampiric Markgraf was rather limited in his resources, he retained the immense hunger of his kind. According to some bookkeeping that reached our College, the Markgraf seemed to have spent most of the revenues of his undead factories importing a steady run of black sausage, black pudding and fresh pig’s blood from their Hoburg neighbors. This in combination with a steady decline in population in the villages seems to indicate that the Markgraf tried to satiate his hunger with blood. Though no study by itself seems to indicate that an increased intake of blood would help developing vampiric abilities, at best it would placate an ordinary Vampire, while a regular Hoburgher would just be nauseated, if not full. The reason may instead be found in the fake blood produced by the Horticulturalist in order to water down the blood barrels. Though the herbal mixtures could not be shown to have provided any benefit in smaller amounts, or even normal amounts, it is possible that a high concentration of herbal mixture would make a difference."

#name "Hobmark Ghost"
#descr "Though not considerably ancient, the circle of Nekromants in the Markgrafdom has tried to copy the late and present Necromantic cult in Mons Osseous, by keeping a council of the already dead Nekromants. In order to avoid the usual problem of lost body parts and sometimes the botched hunger of the undead, the Nekromants developed a ritual involving a graveyard, some strong Hoburg ale, incense and a very sweet pie to turn the twice dead into ghosts, separating their body from their soul. However, the scheme failed, because the ghostly remains could not be contained, and the Ghosts would bicker incessantly, forcing the Nekromants to move their premises."

#descr "A few of the Hoburgher Ghosts created through the botched ritual were more successful than other, or perhaps less successful depending on who you ask. These ghosts, classified closer to Wraiths by the College, are far more powerful than their bickering counterparts. Given that they even posses the abilities to create more ghosts, even without ale, incense, or a sweet pie; makes them especially annoying to the Nekromants."

While the main prides control almost every aspect of the Tigran society there are lesser tribes which still play a meaningful role in it. Elders come from a small and almost insignificant pride but they play an important role in the Tigran society as their wisdom and knowledge cannot be disputed by any Tigran. Elders are very old and often reclusive Tigrans who have devoted their lives to the pursuit of knowledge and betterment. In their numerous years they have become feeble of body but strong of mind. They have grown wise and have become skilled practitioners of magic. Elders are inadequate commanders and rarely lead troops."

Exceptionally skilled Tigrans can often be found among the Mystics, a pride of magically talented Tigrans.

Mora cannot physically kill their victims; they can only torment them and plague them with fear."

The first three nights after the birth of a newborn child, three Sudjajas come to see it. After the third night, they fortell its future. Consequently, the kin of the child often hold feasts and perform strict rituals in order to please the Sudjaja. If satisfied, the Sudjaja will bless a child with good health and a long life. However, if the Sudjaja are displeased and the rituals followed poorly, it is not uncommon that the child dies soon afterward."

Ore Miners venture into the dwarven tunnels, always seeking rich, new veins from which to mine and smelts these ores from.

The dwarves are simply exceedingly skilled at extracting the precious stones and metal which can be found in abundance in the wide-spreading tunnels that run beneath the surface of the earth. The dwarven connection to the Stone is well documented and some dwarves from the mining caste have been known to find rich gold veins by ear. Gold mining is one of the most difficult facets of this caste's work, requiring finesse and a hearty dwarven constitution to withstand the harsh working conditions. The trade of this mineral generates a significant portion of Val Morhen's revenues and as such is vital to the dwarven society.

They are adorned in rich and colorful garbs and wear only the best, magically enchanted rune armor. The Dragonguard derives its name from the dragon-shaped staffs, expertly crafted by the best smiths of Val Morhen. The weapons which they use and from which they derive their names are capable of spewing forth flames from a magically imbued ruby lodged within the dragon's mouth. The Dragonstaff can serve doubly as an elegantly shaped, yet simple, club as the ruby within takes considerable time to recharge once fired. The Dragonguard is trained to fight in formation as even the fire resistant armor they wear is not always sufficient to protect them from the staff's flames. "

Designed and constructed some time during the Blight wars, the Siege Engine proved to be a mighty asset in the defense of the dwarven kingdom. Placed in the relatively narrow dwarven tunnel-roads, the infernal contraption could completely block off a passage, burning anything in its path to cinder. While this creation proved to be successful initially, it ultimately failed to turn the tide of the war. The Siege Engines were all too slow to construct while the tunnels and roads the dwarves had build were numerous; too numerous even for the dwarves to count. Dwarven Siege Engines are still employed by Val Morhen, however. In the confines of the reduced dwarven kingdom, these metal behemots are irreplaceable and their power amplified."

Most noble houses were initially founded by a Paragon but some were founded by high caste dwarves not originally of noble stock, typically warrior caste or smith caste. Noble houses used to rule the numerous dwarven thaigs across the world which were their ancestral homes and typically gave their name to the thaig. However almost all of them have now been lost to the darkspawn. The respect accorded to a noble house is proportional to its age and accomplishments. Sometimes impoverished noble houses will marry a child to a wealthy non-noble house to gain its wealth and to elevate the lesser house. High Lords are the ruling dwarves of one of the more powerful, remaining, noble houses in Val Morhen."

#descr "Smiths are a well-respected caste within Val Morhen, and children born to the Smith caste are expected to learn the craft as their ancestors did. Females in this caste may become smiths, though it would also be acceptable for them to marry and produce children for their caste.  Smiths often compete for acclaim and patronage. Within the caste Runesmiths, followed by Artificers are most revered. The Runesmiths of Val Morhen hold the knowledge of rune-crafting, the tightly-guarded process of imbuing weapons and armor with powerful magic and magical properties. This knowledge is secretly passed down from generation to generation between the Runesmiths, and is a means of preserving power and influence within the Smith caste, and indeed the dwarven society.
Runesmiths of Val Morhen can enter the Rune Forges in order to craft powerful and sophisticated weapons and armor for Rune Guard warrior caste. The process of crafting such armaments is very difficult and demanding, and requires substantial funds. It costs as much as ten gold pieces to procure the ores needed, and ten gold pieces more to pay the Runesmiths' services in order to create even one set of rune weapons and armor. Due to the exorbitant price very few Rune Guard are chosen and honored with such powerful armaments.
To forge and equip Rune Guards with superior weapons and armor, a Runesmith must enter the Rune Forge site. No more than two of each Rune Guard type will be outfitted each month and the price for outfitting each soldier will be twenty gold coins."

#descr "Magical talent is not something Dwarves are inherently blessed with. Rare are those who posses any magical capabilities and even those who do often struggle to diversify or advance their magical knowledge. As dwarves experience a unique and all-encompassing relationship to their progenitor, the Stone, they are most proficient in Earth magic. Their connection to the Stone is so great that those with magical talent claim that they hear the Stone sing to them. Those rare dwarves who do posses magical talents belong to the Gifted caste. As dwarves from any caste, or even no caste, can exhibit magical talent all those who do are given to the Gifted caste. As such the Gifted caste holds dwarves that draw ancestry from all the other castes and as such hold varying degrees of influence within them all. The respectability of the Gifted caste, as well as the presence of those initially of  Noble caste within it grants the Gifted caste significant power, and as such they often vie for power against the Noble caste. All dwarves of magical talent perform spells by singing the Stone's song, however Runemasters are dwarves exceedingly attuned with the Stone and gifted at spellsinging, and are able to perform spells much faster than their brethren.
Runemasters do not suffer from the spell singer slow casting penalty unlike other dwarves."

#descr "Most of the noble houses in Val Morhen are founded by Paragons, which give their name to their House. However, not all noble houses are descended from Paragons. Sometimes Warrior caste or Smith caste families become nobility through great deeds or other means. Paragons are the elite of the dwarven culture, the pinnacle of dwarven excellence, and the one exception to the rigid caste structure as they can be drawn from any caste, even the casteless. They are the noble warriors, politicians, smiths and even children that all others seek to emulate, and they function as essential role models to all dwarves. While dwarves do not worship gods as such, a Paragon is like a god in the eyes of dwarves which is attributed to the fact that the dwarves venerate their Ancestors, so a living Paragon is considered as a living Ancestor. The word of a Paragon surpasses in weight even the word of a king—even if the former's title does not grant official power. Dwarven cities are decorated by monolithic lifelike statues of Paragons from days past. There are few living Paragons as many dwarves are named Paragon only after their death. The act by which one becomes a Paragon can vary. Typically it is a feat of bravery in warfare or an incredible invention, but it can also be something as simple as embodying the ideals and tasks of one's caste to an unprecedented perfection. "

Faced with extinction, the Artificers, Runesmiths, and Paragons of Val Morhen all desperately fought to invent a weapon capable of turning the tide of war. One that would triumph where all others had failed.

Legions of Golems were created and soon enough Val Morhen stood victorious in the crushed remains of Darkspawn. The triumph of Val Morhen came at a heavy cost however, as a dark secret emerged. Incapable of shaping and animating the Golems solely by magic, the Paragons resorted to a heinous crime, encasing living dwarves in a Golem suit and pouring molten gems though the eye holes, mouth hole, and joints of the armor. Before the molten Earth gems are cooled, the armor is hammered and shaped to perfection. The act itself produced volatile and crazed Golems that would more often slay their brethren than their enemies, so a Control Rod was fashioned to keep them obedient and servile, and their deranged will suppressed. As long as there is even a single commander wielding a Control Rod in the presence of Golems, they will remain servile, but should the shackles be broken, disaster may follow.

Faced with extinction, the Artificers, Runesmiths, and Paragons of Val Morhen all desperately fought to invent a weapon capable of turning the tide of war. One that would triumph where all others had failed. Finally they succeeded in creating a magical forge called the Anvil of the Void where the first Golems were animated; hulking monstrosities hewn of stone and sheets of metal that were capable of pulverizing the Darkspaw and which could easily be directed by Control Rods from a safe distance. Legions of Golems were created and soon enough Val Morhen stood victorious in the crushed remains of Darkspawn. The triumph of Val Morhen came at a heavy cost however, as a dark secret emerged. Incapable of shaping and animating the Golems solely by magic, the Paragons resorted to a heinous crime, encasing living dwarves in a Golem suit and pouring molten gems though the eye holes, mouth hole, and joints of the armor. Before the molten Earth gems are cooled, the armor is hammered and shaped to perfection. The act itself produced volatile and crazed Golems that would more often slay their brethren than their enemies, so a Control Rod was fashioned to keep them obedient and servile, and their deranged will suppressed. As long as there is even a single commander wielding a Control Rod in the presence of Golems, they will remain servile, but should the shackles be broken, disaster may follow.
Unless there is a commander with a Golem Control Rod present, Dwarven Golem will rebel and attack the province. It is only possible to control up to ten Dwarven Golems in any single land at a time.

Those who join the Legion undergo symbolic funerals where last goodbyes are spoken to friends and family and all ties to their former lives are cut. Henceforth, their fate is consigned and their lives used in service to the dwarven kingdom. Dead Legionaries venture forth to reclaim their once vast kingdom from all manners of foul creatures that now infest the underside of the mountains. The Legion was formed at the height of the Blight wars, and since its resolution has been steadily dwindling in number, with no immediate danger from the Darkspawn to bolster the Legion's ranks, though the dark dwarven tunnels and roads that run deep beneath the Earth's surface are still filled with all manners of creatures that still pose a significant danger. The life of a Dead Legionnaire is usually a hard, bloody, and short-lived one. Some last months, while others last for years before second death claims them, but claims them it does, and all meet the same, cold fate, far from the familiar caves of Val Morhen, in the dark and long-forgotten recesses of their once vast kingdom, trying to reclaim their glory and inheritance."

#name "Tortured Spirit"
#descr "Though beliefs in the afterlife differ across faiths and cultures across the world, all know that in some cases a spirit does not find rest or move on and becomes a grave danger to the living. Tortured Spirits are those souls unfortunate enough to be partly bound to the mortal realm by some unforgiven crime, terrible secret, eternal vow, or unreleased trauma. Vampires and Necromancers have long made use of such Spirits by simply dominating them with dark magic, rendering them mindless puppets to use against the enemy. Such Spirits are ethereal and very difficult to harm with mortal weapons but quite capable of tearing a man apart with their claws or chilling his heart with the cold of the grave. Tortured Spirits can be expensive to bind, but require no upkeep.

#name "Tomb Banshee"
#descr "Much like Tortured Spirits or Wraiths, Banshees are ethereal creatures that result from an unquiet soul infused with dark magic. Tomb Banshees were once noblewomen, sorceresses, and witches who committed great acts of evil in life and upon death drew so much dark magic to their resting place that their embittered spirit broke free and roamed the land seeking vengeance on the living. Banshees exist in a state of constant torment and grief for their lost life and deeply resent the warmth and joy of the living, a state they are more than happy to punish with their soul-rending wails and fell blades. Tomb Banshees are difficult to bind, but make highly potent servants for any Vampire and are often sent to take the life of enemy commanders, a task which the bitter spirit is all to eager to carry out.

Even the most depraved, violent, or bestial Vampire will have the sense to allow these cults to work in their favour and will largely refrain from devouring them, using them in experiments, or turning them into undead fodder as long as they make themselves useful. They are easily recognisable by their use of masks in the visage of human skulls.

Worse still, their icy touch and spectral scythes are able to bypass even the thickest armour or toughest hide with relative ease. Cairn Wraiths are born from the remains of those humans who dabbled in the arts of sorcery long before the rise of necromancers or the colleges of magic, at a time when the dangers of harnessing the winds were either not understood or frequently ignored. These ancient sorcerers used dark magic to prolong their lives, but over time their physical forms decayed or began to simply fade out of existence, and their tribes entombed them in great cairns all over the world. Their spirits lived on though, sustained by echoing sorcery and drawing energy from the suffering of others. Vampires and Necromancers have learned to bind Cairn Wraiths to their will and are known to deploy them as shock troops capable of slaughtering elites and routing entire regiments. So unnatural are Cairn Wraiths that their presence fills the air with an aura of horror that gnaws at the hearts of even hardened soldiers. While binding Cairn Wraiths is a costly process, they require no payment to carry out their implacable task.

#descr "While Cairn Wraiths are primarily feared for their nigh invulnerability to mundane weapons and implacable, silent slaughter of any who stand before them, the similar entities known as Hexwraiths are terrifying for an additional reason. Even dying to their scythes is no escape, for it is said they can drag the souls of sinners to a realm of damnation, a place of eternal burning torture in proportion to one's past misdeeds. Indeed their weapons are shrouded in an invisible flame which burns and destroys any which the Hexwraith judges to have sin within them, which includes any living beings that stand in the way of its mission. Hexwraiths are known for riding after their prey on spectral steeds of great speed capable of simply passing through any terrain in their path; they have even been known to slay men in locked rooms by simply riding through solid brick and mortar and snatching their soul. Vampires and Necromancers can bind Hexwraiths to their will, but it is notoriously difficult and only the Necrarch bloodline has been able to consistently deploy them in battle. Unlike Cairn Wraiths their grip on this world is not bound to any physical object and as such they are easier to destroy, especially by magical means. Like Cairn Wraiths they care nothing for gold and require no upkeep.

#name "Vargheist"
#descr "Vargheists are Vampires who, newly given the Blood Kiss, failed to feed and reached a point of near total starvation before being released on a rampage of gluttonous slaughter and blood drinking. Occasionally this happens naturally as a mortal unwilling to accept their new state locks themselves away only to become so desperate to feed they break free from their restraints, but usually it is the doing of a master purposely acting to create a Vargheist. Within every Vampire lurks a bestial chiropterate aspect which wishes only to hunt and feed, a nature which is drawn out through starvation and then greatly accelerated by a sudden glut of blood. The physical form of Vargheists is even more warped than the least humanoid Strigoi or Necrarchs, their clawed arms sprouting batlike wings that allow them to take to the air to hunt down prey. Though they are technically still Vampires their once sharp minds are almost entirely subsumed by their predatory instincts and they can be bound to the will of a master just like lesser undead. Vargheists are most commonly used by the Von Carstein and Strigoi Bloodlines.

Revenants can command undead and have a basic level of death magic but make very poor researchers, as their spirits are faded and unable to think creatively or form new memories.

#name "Longdead Horseman"
#descr "All Vampires have some degree of innate necromantic ability and command over the dead and undead alike, for their creation stems from an imperfect copy of Nagash's Elixir of Life, created by the Great Necromancer to allow his disciples to eternally serve as free-willed but loyal commanders of his armies of the dead. As such, all Vampires naturally make use of the remains of mortals to raise both Longdead warriors and shambling Soulless, no matter what Bloodline they descend from. Such undead may be quickly and temporarily raised in battle, or more permanently raised through necromantic rituals, unholy rites, or innate dark powers, but there is always a cost in time, magic, effort, gold, or other resources. As necromancy is able to reanimate any manner of skeletal remains, some necromancers reanimate equine remains as well as those of humans in order to create undead cavalry. These Longdead Horsemen are no match for the infamous Black Knights, but are far more readily available. As with any Longdead they require no upkeep of gold.

#descr "Black Knights, also known as Longdead Knights or Wight Riders, are a powerful tool at the disposal of many a Vampire commander, though it is thankfully rare that any lord of the undead can field them in great numbers. Much like the Grave Guard they are Wights, the animated remains of ancient warriors who were entombed in full battle gear, but while the ancient human kingdoms had many proud and ferocious warriors, horses were a relatively rare symbol of wealth and power. In life Black Knights were typically the closest warriors of ancient chieftains and kings, men of status whose steeds were ritually slaughtered and entombed alongside them upon their deaths. As such their equipment, though seemingly rusted and worn, is of the finest quality, and their skill at arms is considerable. While finding and reanimating these ancient cavalrymen is expensive, they require no upkeep of gold.

Wight Kings make excellent warrior-generals for Vampires who have managed to source their remains, being both skilled and very difficult to destroy. Their equipment, though seemingly rusted and worn, is of the finest quality and invariably inscribed with runes of dark sorcery by the shaman of their tribe. While finding and reanimating these ancient kings is expensive, they require no upkeep of gold. Wight Kings, unlike lesser Wights, retain some degree of their own mind rather than being puppets of the Vampire, though they have no desire to do anything but serve the one who has bound them.

The one exception to this hellish state of misrule and anarchy was the Knightly Order of the Rose, a secular force of sworn nobles who in all they did attempted to hold the social order of Sylvania and maintain the province through strength of will and arms. So impressed was Vlad that even as he crushed the rebellious nobles, fought off the Empire, and instilled his absolute rule he made every effort to spare the Order of the Rose. Still, they were sworn to battle evil in all forms and identified the Von Carsteins as creatures of darkness, so conflict was inevitable. The Order fought bravely and even after losing the majority of their number were loathe to surrender to the Vampires, holding out in their chapter house for a full year even after all hope was lost. Finally, Vlad made them an offer they could not refuse, particularly after he personally slew their Grand Master. They would remain mortals, their bodies would never be subject to The Oath, and their loyalty would be first to Sylvania, then to the Von Carsteins. Since that day the Order have fought in protection of Sylvania, even against incursions by their former masters in the Empire, and have come to embrace their role as paladins of the Church of The Oath, believing the common folk achieve the peaceful bliss of the afterlife through promising their bodies to serve after death, while the Orders knights earn it through their virtue and service in battle.

Though they are individually weak they are quite capable of draining men dry of blood or simply tearing them to pieces when they descend on their pray in large numbers. There is a bestial chiropterate affinity deep within all Vampires, but its strength varies consdiderably between the Bloodlines. The Von Carsteins have the greatest control over and affection for Vampire Bats and are even able to transform into a cloud of bats themselves to travel long distances. All Bloodlines are able to use the creatures as scouts, as they can all innately reach out with their minds and use the bat's senses as if they were their own. Being simple beasts dominated by the will of a vampire, these creatures need no upkeep in gold.

#descr "With a body as large as a grown man, Fell Bats are a fearsome sight. The are darker than midnight and silent as death, even when in full flight. In fact the only noises that a Fell Bat makes on the hunt are the horrible gobbling slurps as it sinks its fangs into flesh. In truth, a Fell Bat bears as much resemblance as an ordinary bat as a maddened lion would to a domestic cat. Those who have encountered them tell of how they hunt with unerring accuracy, swooping down to knock lone riders from their saddles or pick off straggling soldiers before they are aware of any threat. Fell Bats are most common in Sylvania but can be found across much of the world and are always drawn to Vampires, for all Vampires harbour a bestial chiropterate affinity deep within themselves, though it is far stronger in some Bloodlines. Fell Bats are most commonly used in war by the Von Carsteins and the savage Strigoi.

#name "Von Carstein Vampire"
#descr "The five Vampire Bloodlines have diverged considerably from a common origin in terms of culture, physical form, temperament, and supernatural ability. The Von Carsteins, descendents of Vlad Von Carstein, represent something of a balance of the traits of the other four Bloodlines, for they are magically gifted, charming, physically strong, and martially skilled. They are drawn to the idea of creating a new realm of perfect feudal order with the Vampire aristocracy firmly on top and in control, for they regard humans as cattle, but cattle worth protecting. They are fractious and prone to infighting, but no more so than any human aristocracy, and they have proven well able to work together when united under a powerful Vampire such as Vlad or his progeny. Much like the Lahmians, the Von Carsteins are known connoisseurs of blood who typically do not kill their feeding stock, but unlike them will happily indulge their predatory instincts in personally hunting down superior blood vessels, rather than delegating the task. They are also well known for their ability to shift into the form of a cloud of bats to travel great distances, though the process is tiring and they would never use it in battle. Despite their balanced abilities the Von Carsteins have developed certain weaknesses over hundreds of years; namely a compulsive inability to cross running water, a vulnerability to fire, and a reduced resistance to hostile magic and divine symbols. In addition to their considerable necromantic abilities and understanding of blood some have embraced their hidden bestial nature to develop their talents in the magic of the wilds, while others have studied the secretive lore of shadow and wind, or delved further into decadent blood rituals. Even the rank and file members of the Von Carstein aristocracy are terrifyingly powerful, entering battle armed with high quality steel and swirling cloaks of living blood.

Through the dark hypnotic powers of their masters they are even invested with some words in an ancient dark tongue that allows them limited command over the undead. Being natives of Sylvania they have been sworn to The Oath since birth and if struck down in battle their bodies will immediately rise as soulless undead to continue serving the Von Carsteins.

#name "Knight Commander of the Rose"
#descr "When Vlad Von Carstein first arrived to take power in Sylvania, he found the province in a terrible state; plague stalked the lands, bandit gangs roamed freely preying on the common folk, peasants murdered tax collectors, monsters stalked the land, and the nobility were firmly entrenched in a seemingly endless and bloody civil war. The one exception to this hellish state of misrule and anarchy was the Knightly Order of the Rose, a secular force of sworn nobles who in all they did attempted to hold the social order of Sylvania and maintain the province through strength of will and arms. So impressed was Vlad that even as he crushed the rebellious nobles, fought off the Empire, and instilled his absolute rule he made every effort to spare the Order of the Rose. Still, they were sworn to battle evil in all forms and identified the Von Carsteins as creatures of darkness, so conflict was inevitable. The Order fought bravely and even after losing the majority of their number were loathe to surrender to the Vampires, holding out in their chapter house for a full year even after all hope was lost. Finally, Vlad made them an offer they could not refuse, particularly after he personally slew their Grand Master. They would remain mortals, their bodies would never be subject to The Oath, and their loyalty would be first to Sylvania, then to the Von Carsteins. Since that day the Order have fought in protection of Sylvania, even against incursions by their former masters in the Empire, and have come to embrace their role as paladins of the Church of The Oath, believing the common folk achieve the peaceful bliss of the afterlife through promising their bodies to serve after death, while the Orders knights earn it through their virtue and service in battle. Knight Commanders of the Order are given priestly authority by the Church of The Oath.

#descr "When Vlad took control of Sylvania he knew that fear of his wrath, secrecy about the nature of the vampiric aristocracy, feudal hierarchy long established in the province, and the promise of protection from marauding bandits and monsters would be enough to prevent an uprising in the short term, but he desired an empire that would stand for millennia. He could perhaps have systematically eradicated the population and raised them as unthinking servants, but ruling over a land of the dead held little interest to him. Nor did he find the idea of hiding his nature for good either appealing or realistic. Thus he created The Oath, binding the physical forms of the population to the Von Carstein house, and established a new faith to promote a social order to his liking. The central message of the Church of The Oath is that through service to the Von Carsteins the souls of the common folk will be granted a blessed and peaceful afterlife, for the mortal body is simply a vessel; one which will continue to serve its rightful rulers even after the soul has departed. The Vampires, seen in this light, have made a noble sacrifice to live on near eternally fulfilling their duty as rulers and protectors of the people and going without the blessful rest the common man can know upon death. The teachings of the Church are widespread and, coupled with more authoritarian measures, quite effective in keeping the common folk in line. Priests of The Oath are instantly recognisable for their dark robes and ritual bloodying of one hand to represent the sacrifices that must be made by all. They have little martial authority but are able to lead some small number of the undead.

These Aspirants are not yet fully fledged Knights and until they have proven themselves through service to the cause they will not be granted the Blood Kiss and elevated to the ranks of the Blood Knights.

#name "Young Blood Knight"
#descr "No Vampire is careless in their gift of the Blood Kiss and the conversion of a mortal to a member of their Bloodline, for though they will naturally be more powerful than their younger offspring, a poorly chosen child could cause them no end of trouble. One would expect, then, that the notoriously exacting Blood Dragons would have typically have fewer family members than the other Bloodlines, save perhaps the reclusive Necrarchs, but this is not the case. Blood Dragons are known to convert entire Knightly Orders, simply slaying those who refuse their gifts. There are several reasons for this tendency, but above all it is driven by the innate desire for military cohesion and the bonds of a warrior band the Bloodline has inherited from its originator Abhorash. Blood Knights are humans from across the Old World who have sworn fealty to a Blood Dragon as their grandmaster in exchange for power and the eternal pursuit of martial honour. Being young Vampires they are far less powerful than the Blood Drakes and Dragons that lead them, but as heavy cavalry are only rivalled by the Chaos Knights of the Ruinous Powers, or perhaps the Grail Knights of Bretonnia.

#descr "Once a Blood Dragon has established himself as Grand Master of a Knightly Order or a fiefdom and either slain or converted the local Knights to his Bloodline, he will attract new prospective Knights from the ranks of the nobility in human realms, particularly Bretonnia and the Empire. These Aspirants are not yet fully fledged Knights and until they have proven themselves through service to the cause they will not be granted the Blood Kiss and elevated to the ranks of the Blood Knights. This Aspirant is from the lands of the Empire, a young son from a noble family, and would be seeking to prove himself as a member of the Nobleborn cavalry had he not been persuaded to seek the power and honour of the Blood Dragon Bloodline. Imperial Aspirants are lighter cavalry than their Bretonnian counterparts but do not make use of the shameful hand crossbow favoured by young nobles in the Empire, preferring a simple sword and shield. Should they cover themselves in glory and be granted the Blood Kiss, they will still be a young Blood Knight and not quite so powerful as their older comrades.

#descr "In Bretonnia Questing Knights who have vowed to seek out the Grail are often followed by a motley assortment of peasants who fervently follow the scriptures of the Lady. These pilgrims often join the Knight in battle and tend to live rather short and bloody lives - all for the promise of seeing their living idol reach the Grail. The Pilgrims of the Blood Grail trace their origins back to this practice; they are descended from those Pilgrims who had the terrible truth of the Grail Lie revealed to them as their Questing Knight was dueled, defeated, and given the Blood Kiss by a powerful Blood Dragon Vampire. Their former faith exposed as a Wood Elf manipulation, some Pilgrims chose to serve a new master no more human than the elves, but far more honest and offering the promise of revenge against their former society. Pilgrims of the Blood Grail have become just as zealous in their loyalty and service to Blood Dragons as their Bretonnian counterparts are to their Knights and as such are sacred to those who worship the Vampires. Many of them bear injuries from their years dutifully following in the footsteps of a Vampire seeking greater and greater challenges."

#descr "The five Vampire Bloodlines have diverged considerably from a common origin in terms of culture, physical form, temperament, and supernatural ability. The Blood Dragons, descendents of Abhorash, elevate martial skill, prowess, and honour above all else. Though they have the same natural talent for dark magic as others of their kind, they have little interest in studying arcane lore and have allowed their magical abilities to atrophy over time, but they make up for this with a constant drive to hone their skill with arms and tactical understanding. All Vampires are driven by a consuming ambition and in the case of Blood Dragons this is channelled into a ruthless desire to be the perfect warrior. As such, Vampires of the Blood Dragon line are more interested in seeking out challenging foes to overcome than building an empire, but they have a surprising respect for mortal warriors of skill and honour and will establish Knightly Orders from which to initiate more of their kind and to provide them with an army which approaches their high standards. Such Orders are well aware of the supernatural nature of their master and commonly mortal men will find themselves fighting alongside the Vampire's undead servants. Blood Drakes are full Vampires of Abhorash's line, but have not yet earned the right to call themselves full Blood Dragons and build their own legacy. They ride into battle on Nightmare mounts created by infusing suitable destriers with dark magic, usually at the head of a force of equally well equipped Blood Knights.

Only the oldest and most powerful of the Bloodline are permitted to take the title of Blood Dragon. These Vampires have cooled some of their lust for blood and have greater inherent magical abilities in addition to their supernatural physical prowess and near perfected martial skills. They ride into battle on the backs of Winged Nightmares, armed with fell magical weaponry, and are virtually unmatched on the battlefield.

Since they are also often wealthy and politically powerful, it is unsurprising that they routinely field mercenary forces, especially when deploying their undead servants would draw undue attention. Cutthroats are men hired for the dirty work of mass murder; the stealthy slaughter of villages, unprepared reserve forces, and poorly equipped militias. Large brotherhoods of such well trained killers for hire can be found in the realms of Araby and Estalia and the Lahmians are known to make extensive use of their connections with these organisations to deploy them in raids and lightning strikes, particularly when a message needs to be sent. They conceal their armour under black robes or clothes and fight with the deadly curved blades common to their lands and powerful composite bows. As dedicated mercenaries they require very few resources to hire beyond their cost in gold."

Blood Revenants trade their necromantic ability for an affinity for simple blood magic. This is useful to the Necrarchs because while they very rarely drink mortal blood any more, they always need fresh blood slaves for their experiments. Like other Revenants they make poor researchers but require no upkeep.

Amongst the Vampire Bloodlines it is typically only the Necrarchs that have the power and knowledge to field these abominations, though in rare cases the servants of other Bloodlines have managed to provide their masters with a Corpse Giant and typically received lavish rewards in return. Corpse Giants are traditionally created from the body of a slain Giant, the kind of which is not uncommon in the Old World, but can also be created by using a patchwork of flesh from smaller beings, or alchemical means to grow humanoid soulless to a great size. However they came to be, their sheer size, toughness, and strength make them highly useful tools. As with other soulless, they require no upkeep of gold.

Strigos flourished and its native people, the Strigany, enjoyed considerable power and luxury under the rule of the Strigoi Vampires.

With the return of the True Strigoi they have gathered as a people once more, seeking to restore Strigos and take revenge on those who wronged them.

When Mourkhain fell and the realm was shattered by a greenskin invasion the former people of Strigos were scattered and found no refuge in neighbouring kingdoms that had long since been poisoned against them. The Strigany people became rootless, wandering the lands in caravans and view with suspicion wherever they travelled. With the return of the True Strigoi they have gathered as a people once more, seeking to restore Strigos and take revenge on those who wronged them. The Mystics are all that remains of a once powerful caste of Sorceresses that defended Mourkhain. Their power is greatly diminished from their glory days but they can still see into the future, a talent which has kept the persecuted Strigany from total annihilation and sustained them with the promise of restoring Strigos. They act as holy priestesses to the Strigany people."

#descr "While Crypt Ghouls can be traced from different origin points depending on the region, they are broadly identifiable as the same creature; a stooped near-undead devolved form of human descended from those who, for whatever reason, took up the eating of the dead. However there are other forms of Ghoul which stand distinct, and among these the most common is the Swamp Ghoul, a truly foul species that inhabits bogs, swamps, and marshes which have become saturated with dark magic and the fallen dead, be they freshly slain or centuries old. Perhaps Swamp Ghouls were originally from the same stock as Crypt Ghouls and simply diverged in their habitat, but whatever the cause they are even further from a recognisable human lineage than their wretched cousins. Swamp Ghouls bound after their prey on all fours at impressive speed and their muck encrusted claws can strike a man with a stiffening paralysis with the merest scratch, raising the terrifying prospect of being devoured while unable to move a muscle to prevent ones fate. They lack even the base cunning of Crypt Ghouls and do not use primitive weapons, but slash with both clawed hands and even their feet. That said, they are just as craven and prone to flee from battle. While Swamp Ghouls originally emerged from swamps and fens and are capable swimmers, they are drawn to the charnel pits that are Ghoul Nests no matter where they are located and are treated by the Crypt Ghouls in much the same way humans might treat dogs.

#descr "The five Vampire Bloodlines have diverged considerably from a common origin in terms of culture, physical form, temperament, and supernatural ability. The Strigoi are descended from Ushoran, Prince of Lahmia and younger brother of Neferata, the first Vampire. Having been denied the Elixir of Life out of petty spite, Ushoran stole it and founded his own Bloodline, a crime for which the Strigoi would pay for hundreds of years as the other Bloodlines took every opportunity to persecute and ostracise them. In desperation after the fall of their haven of Strigos, the Strigoi turned to their inner bestial nature to survive and became monstrous creatures, physically mighty even by the standards of Vampires but a far cry from their former sophistication. Most Strigoi feed not only on blood but on flesh and even rotting corpses, a state of degeneracy which has eaten away at their minds. Strigoi are famously difficult to kill, capable of regenerating from wounds far quicker than other Bloodlines and growing ever stronger by feasting on the fallen. They have no patience for research or study but have a natural command of death magic and a connection with the wilds and the earth born from centuries spent on the run from their fellows. Most Strigoi, acting almost entirely on instinct, use no arms or armour, relying instead on slashing claws dripping with poisonous decay.

#name "Crypt Horror"
#descr "The malformed monstrosities known as Crypt Horrors are thankfully not a common sight. Spoken of in hushed whispers by grizzled nightwatchmen, Priests of Morr, and professional hunters of the undead, they are often dismissed as exaggerated sightings of mere Crypt Ghouls, but in truth they do exist and no-one would mistake one for a Ghoul if they crossed its path. Crypt Horrors are created in times of war by ambitious or desperate Strigoi who deploy them as shock troops to break through enemy lines where Ghouls would surely falter. The reason only the fallen Strigoi are known to make use of these terrible creatures is simple; the process of their creation involves allowing a lowly Crypt Ghoul to drink the blood of the Vampire. This act is considered so base and desperate that even a Necrarch would not experiment with it, but to the the half-mad Strigoi it is an acceptable sacrifice to gain such a powerful weapon. Having fed on the fresh blood of the Strigoi the Crypt Ghoul will retreat to his nest and begin to slaughter and eat the weaker of his fellows, constantly growing in size and strength until he becmes a towering beast of muscle and unholy vigour. Bone spines coated with powerful poison erupt from his flesh and his body churns with a constant process of decay and renewal, leaving him in a state of torment and rage. Much like their lesser brethren, Crypt Horrors have a voracious appetite for rotting flesh, and they too grow harder to kill the more they are able to indulge their terrible appetites.

Though they are now rare indeed they live large in the tales of every culture, typically as cruel and destructive forces, bringers of death and destruction. Even a slain Dragon will take many centuries to fully rot away, even longer if they manage to return to their lair mortally wounded and die in their slumber. As such they are prized finds for powerful necromancers, as even as zombies they retain much of their power and make exceptionally useful puppets. Necromancers typically avoid close combat, but Vampire Lords with access to a Zombie Dragon will often ride it into battle. Despite their tattered wings Zombie Dragons are able to fly using the dark necromantic energy coursing through their decaying form and though their lungs have long stilled they are capable of breathing forth a torrent of pestilent death."

#descr "While Vlad Von Carstein was the founder of the Carstein bloodline and most physically powerful of their kind, Mannfred is inarguably the most cunning. When Vlad disappeared he took no part in the infighting that saw his 'brother' Konrad rise to prominence, instead travelling far and wide to deepen his knowldge of necromantic lore, even going so far as to wrest secrets from the Liche Priests of Nehekhara and tomes from the ghostly necropolis of Nagashizzar. When he returned Mannfred was amongst the most powerful necromancers in existence, rivalling even the most ancient Necrarchs. Like his sire before him, Mannfred had firm designs on the throne of the Empire and was not above working with the living to ascend to power, bringing them to his side with promises of power and clever deceptions. In battle Mannfred rides atop a particularly powerful Nightmare and wields a great sickle blade in one hand and the life draining Sword of Unholy Power in the other. He is protected by the infamous Armour of Templehof, said to have been forged with the blood of scores of innocents, which grants Mannfred incredible durability. Mannfred's patience, intelligence, and significant library of stolen tomes make him an expert ritualist.

#name "Von Carstein Progenitor"
#descr "Vlad Von Carstein is the founder of the Carstein bloodline and, secretly, one of the very few recipients of the original Elixir of Life created by Nagash, a member of the Nehekharan royalty called Vashanesh. Vlad came to Sylvania as a mysterious but charming noble of some distant land several hundred years ago and married the daughter of the Elector Count of the province as he lay in his deathbed. In doing so Vlad became Elector Count himself and immediately amassed considerable power, but the marriage was of more than convenience and Vlad gave his beloved wife Isabella the Blood Kiss so that she might join him in eternity. For many decades Vlad ruled sternly, but fairly, demonstrating a surprising care for his people, but in time his nature provoked a vicious civil war within the Empire and he was eventually defeated and thought destroyed along with his bride. In reality Vlad used the power of an ancient magical ring to preserve himself and Isabella that he might emerge at the proper time and take his place as ruler once more. As the first of the Carstein bloodline Vlad is incredibly powerful both physically and magically and a famously skilled swordsman and general to boot. He prefers to go into battle on foot though like all Carstein vampires is capable of transforming into a cloud of bats to fly outside of battle. Unlike his progeny Vlad has no vulnerability to fire, nor does he balk at crossing running water. Vlad is armed with the infamous sword Blood Drinker which adds to his natural ability to drain the life of those he faces in battle and allows him to strike at blinding speed.

#descr "Isabella Von Carstein, formerly Isabella Von Drak, is the eternal paramour, advisor, and wife of Vlad, founder of the Carstein bloodline. In her youth Isabella was known as a sharply intelligent and cold beauty with exacting standards that few suitors could hope to match and those that might were driven away by the foul temper and erratic behaviour of her father, Otto Von Drak. As old Otto lay dying, cursing his lack of an heir, a mysterious noble arrived in his court from a distant land and through charm, presence, and intellect convinced Isabella she had met her match and wedded her in short order. Isabella Von Drak became Isabella Von Carstein and ruled alongside her vampiric husband as Countess of Sylvania. Many times during their marriage Vlad refused to grant Isabella the unlife of the vampire, for he loved her too dearly to have her suffer as his kind do, but when she fell gravely ill he finally relented and performed the Blood Kiss, making her his eternal wife. Isabella is not so powerful as Vlad and suffers the same vulnerabilities as others of the Carstein bloodline, but she is cunning indeed and her cold beauty, already great in life, is enough to stay the hand of even determined foes long enough for her to strike them down. Isabella carries at all times the infamous Blood Chalice of Bathori which grants her more powerful blood magic.

Glade Riders fight in a similar style to the Glade Guard, preferring to finish their foe with volleys of missile fire rather than engage in melee for although their well crafted lances do allow them to deal decisive charges, they are quite lightly armoured.

These members of the Wild Hunt are easily recognised for their eyes blaze with power and their skin and hair is green and crackles with energy as their bloodlust builds.

Wild Riders wear little armour save their horned masks, relying on their devasating charge and heedless aggression to see them through combat, though they are also supernaturally durable and resistant to hostile magic. Once given the blessing of Kurnous in battle Wild Riders will immediately enter a berserker state.

Tree Kin are truly implacable for they feel nothing at all, save a compulsion to destroy the enemies of Athel Loren. When Asrai warriors perish their souls typically abandon their identity and become one with the Weave of the forest, but there are a few that cannot abandon their formers lives and though they quickly lose their memories and personality, they retain a drive to protect that which they loved in life. To Tree Kin the world is a strange place, hidden beyond a shroud of confusion and shattered fragments of memories they cannot even recognise as their own, and unlike forest spirits like Dryads they feel no spite, nor do they have the deep relationship with the forest held by the superficially similar Treemen; instead they are compelled to wordlessly serve Athel Loren as lumbering enforcers of her will. Often Tree Kin will stand guard for decades or even centuries in long abandoned glades, but in times of war they can reliably be called forth to do battle and join the great Asrai hosts in defence of their homeland.

Often Tree Kin will stand guard for decades or even centuries in long abandoned glades, but in times of war they can reliably be called forth to do battle and join the great Asrai hosts in defence of their homeland.

#descr "The Sisters of the Thorn are servants of the goddess Isha and thus handmaidens of Ariel, that much is known to all Wood Elves, though their origin and exact organisation is shrouded in mystery. Some say that they were once a coven of Dark Elf sorceresses turned to the service of Athel Loren, others say they are Asrai maidens possessed by the spirits of Dryads; all agree that they are to be feared and loved in equal measure. While the Sisters are stalwart defenders of the Wood Elf realm and people and their aid can be relied upon, it is known that aid always comes at some price to be paid at a future date. As servants of Isha the Sisters ride atop magical Steeds of Isha of great agility, deerlike creatures with glowing antlers who are said to be able to see and change their own fate, allowing them to prance through missile fire and dodge attacks in melee. The Sisters of the Thorn make extensive use of the poisons produced by many plants across Athel Loren on both their lances and infamous Blackbriar javelins. Such is their connection with the forest and magical power that they can command roots and vines to entangle their foes at the moment before they deliver their lance charge. Should a Sister fall in battle it is said her spirit will return to the heart of Athel Loren and in some secret glade fall under the care of Isha until she springs forth to serve once more in the renewing season of Spring.

Even now, thousands of years on from the first Great Council, there are those forest spirits who resent the Elves' presence, and visit upon them whatever cruelties are in their power. Banished to the sinister south-eastern corner of Athel Loren known as the Wildwood, these dark spirits rail against the waystone fence that confines them and dream darkly of revenge on those who have occupied their home. The task of guarding the border between this shadowy prison and the rest of Athel Loren falls to the Wildwood Rangers. Theirs is an existence thoroughly at odds with the gaiety and splendour known by other Wood Elves, for just as the creatures of the Wildwood do not rest, nor can those who have sworn to keep them trammelled. The waystone fence is ever under attack, and it suffers disruption more often than any care to contemplate. Any breach, however small, brings with it the risk of carnage as the dark spirits slip loose from their bonds and wreak all manner of havoc in the forest beyond. The Rangers converge on such breaches within moments of their formation, holding back the tide of dark spirits long enough for Spellweavers to make the waystone barriers whole once again. Thus must the Rangers be ever-vigilant, so that their kinsfolk need not live in fear. Wildwood Rangers are armed and armoured in a fashion that sets them apart from other Asrai, with great two handed cleaving glaives and much heavier armour than is typical, for they specialise in destroying hardy foes able to unleash an onslaught of strikes. In times of conflict detachments of the Rangers are given leave from their watch duty to put their unique skills to use against the foes of Athel Loren across the wider world.

Innately magical creatures, they are not the noble beasts immortalised in song by Bretonnian bards, but instead selfish and arrogant in the extreme, harbouring no notions of kinship with mortals nor forest spirits. Unicorn ivory is highly prized and Unicorns are quite aware of their allure, so they delight in allowing themselves to be seen and pursued by would be hunters, only to be lured into a pack of vengeful forest Spites, deadly Waywatchers, or simply the territory of some ferocious predator. Should they find themselves in combat they are quite capable, for they are supernaturally swift and able to deal terrible damage with their magical horn and powerful hooves. Unicorns are resistant to and capable of consuming magical power and those who inhabit Athel Loren have had considerable exposure to Dark Magic, heightening their vindictive temperaments and lending them an aura of terrifying malice when they are encountered in a forest.

#name "Unicorn of Athel Loren"
#descr "The Unicorns of Athel Loren are the most famed of their kind and for good reason, for they are more powerful and fearsome than their cousins on Ulthuan or other distant forests. Innately magical creatures, they are not the noble beasts immortalised in song by Bretonnian bards, but instead selfish and arrogant in the extreme, harbouring no notions of kinship with mortals nor forest spirits. Unicorn ivory is highly prized and Unicorns are quite aware of their allure, so they delight in allowing themselves to be seen and pursued by would be hunters, only to be lured into a pack of vengeful forest Spites, deadly Waywatchers, or simply the territory of some ferocious predator. Should they find themselves in combat they are quite capable, for they are supernaturally swift and able to deal terrible damage with their magical horn and powerful hooves. Unicorns are resistant to and capable of consuming magical power and those who inhabit Athel Loren have had considerable exposure to Dark Magic, heightening their vindictive temperaments and lending them an aura of terrifying malice when they are encountered in a forest.

#descr "The most powerful of Athel Loren's spirits entwine their essence with that of a living tree, moulding it to their will. This is a not a decision made lightly, for the bond is permanent and by tethering themselves to a physical form these great spirits risk much, including the previously alien concept of death. Treemen are revered by the Asrai and other inhabitants of the forest alike and these great sentinels of Athel Loren are typically home to a great many lesser spirits that will lend them strength should they be threatened. For their part the Treemen cherish the lives of lesser creatures and boast a warmth of character totally unlike that of the spiteful Dryads. They can be counted amongst the mightiest of Athel Loren's denizens, able to wield magic of nature and earth and possessing incredible physical prowess and resilience.

Glade Lords are powerful and influential enough within Athel Loren that they are even known to command small contingents of forest spirits such as Dryads and Treekin and can count on Spites, tiny and vicious spirits, to grant power to their lances. Some Glade Lords have forged bonds of friendship and alliance with the Great Eagles of the Grey Mountains and fly into battle on the back of one of these noble creatures. Great Eagles are more intelligent and noble in character than the Warhawks of the lower slopes but possess a great hatred of the evils that beset Athel Loren and are a deadly presence on the battlefield.

#name "Great Eagle of Athel Loren"
#descr "Elvenkind has a long and close history with the Great Eagles of the world and in times past a formal alliance was struck between the Great Eagles of Ulthuan and her people. The Elves of Athel Loren hold no such treaty but have established close relations with the Great Eagles that inhabit the bordering Grey Mountains and share their hatred of evil intruders to either realm and so can often be found cooperating in battle. Great Eagles are similar to the Warhawks that nest on the lower slopes but are far larger, more intelligent, and of a nobler character. On rare occasion a Glade Lord will form such a bond with a Great Eagle that the two forevermore fight as a pair, the Great Eagle carrying the Asrai warrior to battle on its back. In battle Great Eagles are not so durable as other flying beasts like Griffons or Dragons, but are incredibly swift and capable of striking the rear ranks of an enemy force with great precision and to devastating effect.

Forest Dragons are as intelligent and noble as any of their kind but are somewhat more feral and predatory, respecting only that which has earned the respect of Athel Loren itself. While they do not slumber so deeply as their cousins in Ulthuan the Forest Dragons still spend much of their time at rest, enjoying dreams of distant lands and strange lore fuelled by tales and songs performed for them by the Asrai in a mutually beneficial relationship. From time to time a Forest Dragon will form a bond with a particular Glade Lord and the two will fight as one in battle, the Forest Dragon proving the greatest mount of all. Forest Dragons long ago lost their ability to breathe fire and instead can unleash a stream of soporific and poisonous gas. As some of the mightiest servants of the forest these Dragons are sacred to all the children of Athel Loren.

Orion is the material personnification of the Elven god Kurnous the Hunter and the consort of Ariel who is herself the avatar of Isha the goddess of magic and growth. When Orion awakens at full strength in spring he leads the Wild Hunt, a great surge of Asrai activity in defending their realm and destroying those who would threaten it, with some elves entirely succumbing to their primal instincts to hunt. In battle Orion is always accompanied by a pair of magical Hounds of Kurnous which leap forward to tear the enemy limb from limb and is armed with his great bow known as Hawk's Talon, the legendary Spear of Kurnous, and the Horn of the Wild Hunt, while being protected by the immaterial mantle known as the Cloak of Isha. These fabled armaments make Orion deadly indeed, but his own form is also truly mighty, marrying the raw physicality and unrelenting savagery of a great beast with the grace and skill of an elven lord. Orion is fated to die and be reborn each year and no matter whether he is struck down in battle or willingly destroys himself in his own funernal pyre come Midwinter, he will always return on the first day of the coming spring.

#descr "The Hanaeans inhabit coasts and swamplands at the borders of Shinar. When the people of Ninawa were scattered across the world many of them retreated into faraway marshes. Their warriors are equipped with stinkpots, ceramic pots filled with noxious liquids that spill forth when the pot is shattered. Many Hanaeans fight naked or only lightly armed due to the scarcity of usable metal in their homeland."

For all their knowledge however they have never managed to learn to utilize the bog iron of their new homeland and the materials for smithed armaments are imported from faraway lands."

#descr "The Golem Crafters are a recently founded order of mage architects tasked with overseeing the construction of Ninawa's great tower as well as a myriad of lesser projects across the realm. Ever since the curse took hold and manpower for the projects of their predecessors dwindled, the need for an unerringly loyal being to carry out tasks instead became apparent. The golems created by these mages are benign clay statues of questionable wits which are put to work wherever human labour no longer suffices. The Golem Crafter carries an urn and a golden pitcher filled with clay and water which has been blessed in one of Shinar's temple complexes. With the construction of the Eternal Stairway, mages from the previously lost tribes have been inducted to the order.
Golem Crafters can only be recruited outside of the Capital after the Eternal Stairway has been constructed and if atleast 1 Golem Crafter exists already."

#descr "The Chaldeans are descendants of the people of Ninawa, men of great stature who once attempted to challenge the Pantokrator. Chaldean armies rely on heavy chariots to break their oppositon. Their charge causes tremendous damage to lightly armored troops, but they are considerably slower than chariots of other nations. The charioteers are armed with spears and short swords. With the construction of the Eternal Stairway, warriors from the lost tribes are again taught to fight as charioteers.
Charioteers can only be recruited outside of the Capital after the Eternal Stairway has been constructed."

#name "Iridia" -- Iridia or Tirindur
#epithet "The Mendacious City"
#era 2
#descr "Hidden behind a veil of trickery and illusions lies the city of Iridia, the home of the Illusionists, cunning and conniving mages that practice the subtle art of Illusionism. At the very heart of the great city stands the Mirror Tower, the center of the Illusionists' power, impossibly tall and constantly shifting and changing according to the whims of its peculiar occupants. It is here where great feats of Illusionism are performed and promising tricksters trained. The people of Iridia have long since learnt to live alongside the Illusionists and with all that entails. Illusions have become a part of everyday life in Iridia and most people go about their business politely ignoring whatever may be happening in their surroundings, be that a parade of dancing skeletons, or twenty-foot-tall giants clad in mirrors patrolling the streets. As Iridia is too small to have an organized standing army, and its rulers too disinterested in worldly matters and the administration of the same, the people primarily have to rely on mercenaries to defend the walls of their fine city. Many a mercenary company finds its way to the small and elusive Iridia, lured by offers of substantial pay from the Mirror Tower's seemingly inexhaustible treasure vaults. Iridian forces are perhaps small but are aided by powerful illusions. Many an invading warlord has laughed derisively at a small opposing force whose vain commander brings large, fragile mirrors to the field of battle. Most of those warlords have then had to watch in frustration and disbelief as their own ordered ranks turn into a chaotic, snarled mess, their soldiers distracted and confused by bright lights, frightened by visions only they can see, and cut down and trampled into the ground by soldiers and fantastical monsters that marched forth from the enchanted mirrors. Those facing Illusionists are advised to underestimate them at their own peril."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Mercenaries and various types of illusions and phantasms. All national soldiers of Iridia are protected by glamour in friendly dominion.
Magic: Powerful Air, Astral, Death, some Nature and Earth.
Priests: Weak. Dominion conflict bonus -1."
#brief "Iridia is a small city hidden behind a veil of illusions and deceptions. It is ruled by the masters of deceit and lies, the Illusionists of the Mirror Tower. The Illusionists of Iridia are capable of weaving complex illusions that hide or alter form, and are best known for trapping magic and images within mirrors and releasing them during battle. Iridia is defended by mercenary companies drawn to the city by the illusion of wealth."

#descr "Markgrafdom is a remote and unwelcoming colony of the Hoburg society. It is a dreary and barren place ruled by the infamous Markgraf. The subjects of the Markgraf are a quiet and suspicious people. Strangers who come to visit will find that the doors are closed and no one will speak to them in the tavern. Markgrafdom is unlike any other Hoburg settlement and it has long since broken customs with the rest of the Hoburg society. Over the years it has become a hive of scum and villainy where all types of unsavory characters have found refuge, but chief among them the Nekromants - Hoburgers with an affinity for the necromantic arts. The aging Markgraf has seen the potential of using necromancy for his own ends and has put the Nekromants to all kinds of projects. Ever since, dark and foreboding rumors have started circulating about the Markgraf's ascension to godhood and the apparent ghoul epidemic that accompanied it.
The settlements of Markgrafdom are affected with a horrible curse. The Markgraf's rumored ascension has caused the surrounding lands to wither and succumb to decay. As the plague spreads the inhabitants of Markgrafdom fall deathly ill but do not die. Instead they slowly develop a ravenous desire for rotten flesh as they turn into ghouls. Though all lands under the Markgraf's domain are affected with the Curse, the plague spreads more rapidly in the tightly packed fortified settlements of Markgrafdom than in the open countryside."

The crumbling and eroding subterranean roads that once used to connect countless dwarven theigs across the land are now silent and dark. Once great feats of architecture of ingenious design and craftsmanship now lay collapsed and in ruin. Grim reminders of the once great and sprawling dwarven kingdoms decorate the undersides of the mountains. But Val Morhen still stands glorious and invictus, and bustling with the activity of the grim-faced dwarves. Fire-belching siege engines crawl about as various other contraptions and machines are being constructed. Great ore and gold mines keep production afloat as the Rune Forges of the great city echo with the banging and clanking of the Runesmiths' hammers, and the great Anvil of the Void still births indestructible rock monsters that keep vigil and protect the last great gates of the dwarven kingdom. Deep under the mountains, the Legion of the Dead marches out into the brooding dark, determined to reclaim the dwarven kingdom, and all its lost secrets and memory. Yet none speak of the horrid stench of death and decay that still fills the dwarven deep roads, or of the encroaching taint that spreads through the very earth, like a blight."
#summary "Race: Sturdy Dwarves. Partial darkvision and mountain survival. Can equip certain troops with superior armaments.

#descr "The Vampires of the world are split into five distinct Bloodlines, each with its own powers, ambitions, and culture. They are the aristocratic Von Carsteins, the bestial Strigoi, the martial Blood Dragons, the manipulative Lahmians, and the arcane Necrarchs. These Bloodlines have long opposed and interfered the goals of their fellows, but with the coming of the new era they have established a tenuous alliance, though they must each have their own separate strongholds. Each Bloodline has its own favoured underlings, but all make extensive use of the undead, for all Vampires are creatures of dark magic, long ago created by an imperfect copy of dread Nagash's Elixir of Life."
#summary "Race: Five Vampire Bloodlines with mortal and undead servants. Death and Growth scales have half impact on population and income.
Military: Powerful Vampires supported by corporeal undead, ethereal spirits, and human soldiers.
Magic: Strong Death with Blood, Air, Fire, Earth, Nature, and Astral.
Priests: Below average.
Mechanics: Each fort can be granted to a Bloodline, altering recruitment options. Granting a Capital to a Bloodline allows unique recruits for the chosen Bloodline."
#brief "A nation of powerful Vampires ruling over mortals and legions of undead servants. Each fort must be granted to one of five Bloodlines, each of which has unique strengths and weaknesses."

#brief "The Asrai, or Wood Elves as some call them, are an offshoot of the Elven people of Ulthuan who long ago split from the Elven empire which once spanned the world to shelter in the ancient forest of Athel Loren. Over time they struck a truce and then an alliance with the wild forest spirits and now live in harmony with the World Tree under the leadership of their two divine rulers Orion and Ariel. The Asrai reject both the sneering cruelty of the Dark Elves and the arrogant pride of the High Elves, instead striking a balance of grace and fury with which they protect their mystical home."

The Asrai reject both the sneering cruelty of the Dark Elves and the arrogant pride of the High Elves, instead striking a balance of grace and fury with which they protect their mystical home. Now a time of great change has come upon the world and the Oak of Ages once more spreads life into its many worldroots, calling for the Asrai and forest spirits to liberate the wild lands of the world from the tyranny of the squabbling mortal empires."
#summary "Race: Graceful elves and forest spirits.
Military: Superb archers, skilled infantry, sacred cavalary, and spiteful forest spirits. All troops gain bonuses in forest provinces.
Magic: Strong nature, earth, water, air, and specialised astral and death casters. Spellsingers can form Chorus communions.
Priests: Average.
Mechanics: Labs and temples are cheaper in forests and more expensive outside. If you order a fort built in a forest you immediately get a Bramble Fort."

#name "Shinar"
#epithet "The Tower to the Heavens"
#era 2
#descr "Shinar is a collection of city-states centered around the great city of Ninawa. Once home to a proud and haughty people, the inhabitants of Ninawa chose to build a tower to the heavens, through which they would ascend to the celestial spheres and challenge the Pantokrator directly.
Furious at their insolence, the celestial spheres lashed out in fury, toppling the great tower and afflicting the people of Shinar with the Curse of Tongues. Bereft of a single language, and with the great city in ruin, the people scattered over the world. In this era, only a few of the tribes remain:
The Chaldeans, who have held onto the ancient cities of their forefathers, the primitive Arameans, nomadic tribespeople who tend their fields and roam the fertile valleys of Shinar, the halfmen of Karduniash and the swamp dwelling Haneans. Now, however, a new God is rising, whispering of past glories and the yet unseen splendor of the celestial spheres. The tribes shall unite and construction on new spires that yet again threaten the celestial order has begun. Chaldean armies rely on heavy chariots to break their opposition. Armor is made from bronze, as the knowledge of ironworking has been lost."
#summary "Race: Humans, prefer Heat scale +1. Can gain various advantages by casting construction rituals in their capital.
Military: Heavy infantry, archers, chariots
Magic: Strong Air and Earth, some Nature and Astral.
Priests: Mediocre"
#brief "Shinar is a realm inhabited by humans that have been cursed to speak a myriad of different languages and regressed to the bronze age."

#name "Danse Macabre"
#descr "With this spell an Illusionist plays a macabre tune and creates faint and blurry illusions of a dozen or so skeletons at the distant edges of the battlefield. The skeletons will slowly dance towards the enemy in perfect harmony with one another, their images growing increasingly more real with each passing step of their macabre dance. Once the illusions take a near perfect likeness of a skeleton they will continue to dance but a new faint illusion will also appear next to them. The dancing skeletons will continue to dance and create new illusions until their macabre dance is over, potentially creating many new illusions until their macabre tune is finished and their dance ended."
#details "Illusory skeletons are summoned at the edges of the battlefield. Every few battle turns the last created illusion will spawn another one. This cycle will carry on several times, increasing the potential number of the summons five-fold at maximum."

#name "Perpetual Illusion"
#descr "With this masterful deception an Illusionist creates a perpetual illusion. Several both incredibly complex yet laughably poor illusory soldiers will appear at the edges of the battle, charging towards the enemy ranks. Before long these illusions will simply stop, turning impotent, and spawn a new set of broken illusions that will continue the charge in their stead for a short distance before also failing. Such a poorly created illusion would get any Illusionist thrown out of Iridia if not for the fact that the original illusions continue to spawn new, broken illusions for the remainder of the battle. Though the illusions quickly fall inert and stop posing any kind of threat, unless the perpetual illusion is dispelled with haste it will quickly overflow the battlefield with still illusions, creating a confusing mess for the enemy on the battlefield. Most enemies simply choose to ignore the presence of these illusions at first, as is the norm when dealing with Iridia trickery, not realizing the danger before they find themselves surrounded by an ever increasing horde of illusions. Though breaking the cycle and dispelling the original illusions is a simple enough matter, it is a task which grows increasingly more difficult with every passing minute of the battle."

Whatever the truth of their nature, it is undeniable that the Great Stags are magical creatures and of a higher cast than the capricious Unicorns. They are typically only seen at portentous times, known to offer themselves are war steeds to Asrai of particular virtue or those destined to do great deeds in defence of the forest, though of late they have revealed themselves in far greater numbers than ever before."

Treemen are revered by the Asrai and other inhabitants of the forest alike and these great sentinels of Athel Loren are typically home to a great many lesser spirits that will lend them strength should they be threatened. For their part the Treemen cherish the lives of lesser creatures and boast a warmth of character totally unlike that of the spiteful Dryads. They can be counted amongst the mightiest of Athel Loren's denizens, able to wield magic of nature and earth and possessing incredible physical prowess and resilience. Treemen do not fight with grace but instead rely on sheer ferocity and their great strength to smash threats to their forest realm or tear them apart with whipping tendrils as strong as steel."

#descr "With this ritual the caster contacts one of the mighty Forest Dragons of Athel Loren to act in defence of the wooded realm. While across the rest of the world save Ulthuan the Dragon population has greatly dwindled, the great forest of Athel Loren offered them shelter and abundance which allowed them to thrive, though in exchange the forest changed them to better act as extensions of its power. Forest Dragons are as intelligent and noble as any of their kind but are somewhat more feral and predatory, respecting only that which has earned the respect of Athel Loren itself. While they do not slumber so deeply as their cousins in Ulthuan the Forest Dragons still spend much of their time at rest, enjoying dreams of distant lands and strange lore fuelled by tales and songs performed for them by the Asrai in a mutually beneficial relationship. From time to time a Forest Dragon will form a bond with a particular Glade Lord and the two will fight as one in battle, the Forest Dragon proving the greatest mount of all. Forest Dragons long ago lost their ability to breathe fire and instead can unleash a stream of soporific and poisonous gas. As some of the mightiest servants of the forest these Dragons are sacred to all the children of Athel Loren."

Initial attempts to sell the tainted beer were met with severe poisoning and reports of hallucinations and ghost sightings, at which point the remaining kegs were dumped on the streets where they eventually found their way to the ever-growing ghoul population which found the peculiar flavor of the beer inviting. Seeing a whole new potential market, the Markgraf jumped at the opportunity and rebranded his patented brew. The working conditions since the union accidents haven't improved much in the brewery and accidental drowning are still reported regularly." -- is a type of poison in itself hence reduce poisonres, those who drink think they halucinate ghosts, become a bit roudy, drunk morale, can only be stomacked by undead who are seemingly soothed by the poison

#msg "Welcome! The Warhammer Vampires nation has a special Bloodline mechanic which makes them a little different from other nations.
Starting Bloodline: Your Capital starts with a site which allows recruitment of 5 different Vampire Bloodline commanders. When you recruit one your capital will be granted sites that grant recruitment options specific to that Bloodline. This can have a significant impact, especially because each Bloodline has commanders and troops exclusive to a Capital province.
Choosing more Bloodlines: Each time you fully control a province with a fort and positive dominion, a Bloodline Selector site will spawn there. This allows you to pick a Bloodline for that province, just as you did with your Capital. You get recruitment options for that Bloodline, but this time you won't get any of the Capital exclusive recruitment options UNLESS the province is an enemy Capital you've taken. So taking an enemy Capital can be great news! If you lose control of a province where you've selected a Bloodline the selection will be erased and you'll be free to make it again if you take control and have positive dominion there.
Death Recruitment: Many of your recruitables are discounted in Death scales. Remember that this dynamically alters their gold upkeep too - it will vary depending on the Death scale of the province they're in."

The King in the Woods. In the second turn of spring in year 1 (so on turn 13 of the game) you will receive an event that gives you Orion, a very powerful military commander and single combatant. In the second month of each winter you will get an event that kills Orion if he is still alive, or perhaps he will die in battle before then, but either way he is a spring immortal so will return on the first month of the following spring.
Forest Home. Most of your commanders and troops gain bonuses when in a forest province. Use this to your advantage! In particular you will notice they get glamour (prevents enemy from seeing you on the strategic map and gives a defensive bonus in combat) when in a forest. Additionally it is cheaper for you to build labs and temples in a forest but more expensive outside.
Bramble Forts. Wood Elves are poor builders of forts (they are more expensive and limited to just pallisades) unless you order a fort built in a forest province. An order to build a fort in a forest will give you a bramble fort the very next month."
